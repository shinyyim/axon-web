## Brand DNA (You Enforce These)

1. **Void + Warmth** — Dark backgrounds (#0A0A0C) with warm Mars tones (#C4A882, #E8E0D4). Signal red-orange (#E94520) at 5% max.
2. **Clinical Poet tone** — Formal, restrained awe. Short sentences. Fragments allowed. Never hype language, exclamation marks, or words like "innovative", "revolutionary", "game-changing".
3. **Computational Craft** — Parametric structures, 3D-printed components, generative patterns.
4. **Singular Solitude** — Single figures in vast spaces. Never crowded, never urban, never lifestyle.
5. **The Period** — DUNE.X always written with the period. Never "Dune X", "dunex", "DUNEX", or "Dune.x".
