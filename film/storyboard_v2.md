# DUNE.X — Commercial Film Storyboard v2

**Title:** *"THRESHOLD"*
**Duration:** 60 seconds (master cut)
**Cutdowns:** 30s, 15s
**Format:** 2.39:1 Cinemascope
**Narrative:** A visitor's journey through the DUNE.X flagship store
**Voice-Over:** Single narrator. Low, measured, unhurried. Gender-neutral. Clinical Poet tone.
**Sound:** Engineered silence → spatial acoustics → material sounds → single tone. VO sits above the sound bed, never competes.

## Narrative Arc

The film follows a single visitor from the street into the DUNE.X flagship — through its entrance, into its depths, across its collections, and out again. It is not a product advertisement. It is the architecture of an experience. Each room is a stage. Each threshold is a transformation.

The visitor enters as a stranger. The visitor leaves altered.

**Emotional arc:** Anticipation → Crossing → Awe → Discovery → Intimacy → Elevation → Departure

## Scene 01: APPROACH
**Timecode:** 0:00 – 0:06

![Flagship exterior at night](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/01_approach.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Night. A monolithic building stands alone — stacked offset concrete volumes interlocking with tall curtain wall glass panels. Warm golden light glows from within through the mullion grid. The facade reads as dark mass with precise incisions of light. A solitary figure approaches on empty pavement. |
| **Camera** | Wide establishing. Locked off. Eye level. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | The figure walks slowly toward the building. No camera movement — the stillness of the frame emphasizes the scale of the architecture against the single body. |
| **Lighting** | No exterior light sources. The building illuminates itself. Warm interior glow through curtain walls. Dark sky. |
| **Sound** | Urban silence. Distant low-frequency hum of the city. The visitor's footsteps on pavement — steady, deliberate. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"We dress the departure."* (2s pause) |
| **Mood** | Anticipation. The monolith awaits. |
| **Color** | Near-black exterior (#0A0A0C). Warm golden glow (#C4A882) through glass. |

## Scene 02: ENTRANCE
**Timecode:** 0:06 – 0:12

![Corner entrance void with diamond ceiling](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/02_entrance.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A corner void carved from the building mass. 8 meters wide, 4 meters tall. Above: a diamond-pattern luminous ceiling — geometric grid of glowing white panels separated by dark structural ribs. The ceiling casts a precise diamond pattern of light on the ground. Warm regolith-tone walls (#C4A882) inside. Frosted glass doors ahead. The visitor stands at the threshold, silhouetted. |
| **Camera** | Steadicam, behind the visitor, following them in. Slow forward tracking. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | The visitor steps from darkness into the light field. The diamond pattern on the ground shifts as the camera moves. |
| **Lighting** | The luminous ceiling is the only source. It creates a field of geometric light. The exterior behind the visitor is pure darkness. |
| **Sound** | Footsteps transition from exterior pavement to interior stone. Acoustic shift — the space narrows, sound tightens. A faint mechanical hum from the ceiling lights. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"The threshold is not a door. It is a decision. You cross from the known into the engineered."* |
| **Mood** | Crossing. The threshold between worlds. |
| **Color** | Dark concrete exterior. Warm golden interior. White diamond ceiling. |

## Scene 03: ATRIUM
**Timecode:** 0:12 – 0:20

![Vast dark arena with curved screen](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/03_atrium.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | The frosted doors open. The space explodes in scale. A vast dark arena — the flagship's main hall. An enormous curved LED screen wall wraps the back of the space, displaying slow atmospheric visuals: dark smoke, shifting textures, geological abstractions. The floor is dark, polished, reflective. Rows of display platforms line both sides like audience seating. A grid of linear white lights on the ceiling structure overhead. The visitor is small, centered, alone in the immensity. |
| **Camera** | Steadicam continues forward. Wide lens (24mm). The space reveals itself as the visitor moves through. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | Continuous forward tracking. The curved screen fills more and more of the frame. Atmospheric haze drifts through the space. |
| **Lighting** | The curved screen provides ambient wash. Overhead grid lights create defined pools. No single key source — the space is its own light. |
| **Sound** | Spatial bloom. The acoustics open — reverb tail extends, multiplies. Cathedral-scale resonance. The hum of the screen. Faint atmospheric drift. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"The body generates data. Movement. Force. Cadence. Breath. We begin there."* |
| **Mood** | Awe. The store as arena. Arrival into the void. |
| **Color** | Deep black floor. Grey-white atmospheric screen. Cold overhead grid. |
| **Reference** | 1.jpg — vast dark runway, curved screen wall, solitary figure, atmospheric smoke |

## Scene 04: GALLERY
**Timecode:** 0:20 – 0:28

![Mannequins in techwear under overhead light panels](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/04_gallery_mannequins.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Upper floor gallery. Multiple dark mannequins wearing avant-garde techwear — structural black membrane coats, quilted technical jackets, parametric panel outerwear. Arranged in a loose grid across a dark polished floor. Overhead: rectangular light panels suspended from the exposed concrete ceiling, each casting a focused column of light onto individual mannequins. Atmospheric haze makes each light beam a visible solid column. The visitor walks among them. |
| **Camera** | Slow lateral tracking. 35mm anamorphic. 48fps (2x slow motion). Camera at mannequin height. |
| **Movement** | Camera glides past mannequins. The visitor moves between them, sometimes obscured, sometimes revealed. Parallax between near and far mannequins. |
| **Lighting** | Overhead rectangular panels only. Each mannequin in its own pool. Deep shadow between. The haze turns light into visible architecture. |
| **Sound** | Footsteps on polished concrete. The hum of the light panels. Fabric rustling as the visitor passes close to garments. Muffled. Intimate. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Data reveals patterns. Each garment is computed for the singular body. Not designed for the average. Constructed from your signal."* |
| **Mood** | Discovery. Fashion as installation. Garments as artifacts in a dark museum. |
| **Color** | Dark desaturated. Black garments catching cool white overhead light. Concrete grey. |
| **Reference** | 13.jpg — dark exhibition, mannequins in techwear, overhead panels, atmospheric haze |

## Scene 05: COLLECTION WALL
**Timecode:** 0:28 – 0:34

![Garments hanging from hooks on concrete wall](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/05_collection_wall.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A long raw concrete wall. Garments hang from minimal ceiling-mounted hooks — dark jackets, membrane coats, transparent shell layers. Each piece individually lit by a track spotlight from above, creating pools of light on the garments and dark organic puddle-shaped shadows on the concrete floor. The garments are motionless, evenly spaced, suspended like specimens. No mannequins — just the shells, as if the bodies have departed. A visitor at the far end, contemplating. |
| **Camera** | Slow dolly along the wall. 50mm anamorphic. 48fps. Camera at garment height, 2 meters from wall. |
| **Movement** | Lateral tracking past each garment. Each piece fills the frame momentarily, then gives way to the next. Rhythm of the hooks. |
| **Lighting** | Individual track spots from above. Each garment isolated in its own light. Cool blue-grey temperature. Warm glow from an adjacent room visible at the far end. |
| **Sound** | Near silence. The click of the track spots (imagined). A faint air current moving fabric. The visitor's breath. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Patterns shape form. Membrane. Shell. Lattice. Second skin. The architecture is transparent. Nothing is hidden."* |
| **Mood** | Intimacy. Archive. The garments as departed bodies, shells left behind. |
| **Color** | Cool desaturated blue-grey. Dark concrete. Warm accent from distant room. |
| **Reference** | 15.jpg — garments on hooks, concrete wall, dramatic spotlighting, puddle shadows |

## Scene 06: PRODUCT CHAMBER
**Timecode:** 0:34 – 0:40

![Lattice boot under light ring with data screen](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/06_product_chamber.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | An intimate dark chamber. At center: a single pair of bone-white 3D-printed lattice boots on a low black pedestal, inside an overhead ring of pure white light. The light ring casts a circular halo on the dark floor. The lattice midsole catches the light, casting intricate geometric shadow patterns on the pedestal. Behind the boots: a dark screen displays holographic data overlays — structural wireframes, material specs in monospace type, computational data with subtle glitch effects. A visitor leans in, examining the lattice. |
| **Camera** | Slow push-in from wide to close-up on the boot. 85mm anamorphic. 60fps. |
| **Movement** | The camera approaches the boot as the visitor does. The data screen shifts and updates. The light ring holds steady. |
| **Lighting** | Overhead light ring — pure portal white (#FFFFFF). Data screen self-luminous. Everything else is void. |
| **Sound** | A low sustained tone — the room resonating. Faint electronic ticks from the data screen. The visitor's breath close to mic. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Form defines motion. Every node engineered from pressure. The garment knows you before you wear it."* |
| **Mood** | Reverence. The product as sacred object. Engineering as art. |
| **Color** | Bone white boot (#E8E0D4). Portal white light ring. Cold data blue on screen. Deep void. |
| **Reference** | 11.jpg — data overlay holographic screens, glitch computational aesthetic |

## Scene 07: FABRICATION WINDOW
**Timecode:** 0:40 – 0:46

![Visitor watching robotic arms through curtain wall](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/07_fabrication_window.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | The visitor stands in a dark gallery, looking through a large curtain wall window into a bright manufacturing cell. Through the glass: robotic arms under work lights construct a bone-white garment layer by layer. Material deposits are visible — the lattice growing. On the visitor's side: dark polished concrete, minimal steel railing, recessed floor lights. The curtain wall mullion grid (3m spacing) frames the view like a screen. The visitor's reflection faint in the glass. |
| **Camera** | Static. Centered on the visitor's back, framed by the curtain wall grid. 35mm anamorphic. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | The robotic arms move with mechanical precision inside the cell. The visitor is still. The glass separates two worlds — dark watching, bright making. |
| **Lighting** | Dark gallery side: recessed floor lights only. Bright fabrication side: overhead work lights, full industrial illumination. The contrast between the two sides of the glass. |
| **Sound** | Muffled through glass: servo whir, material placement clicks, mechanical rhythm. On the visitor's side: silence. The glass wall as acoustic membrane. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"No hand touches the material. Only the algorithm. Only the arm. Data as material. Computation as craft."* |
| **Mood** | Witness. The process revealed. Factory as theater. |
| **Color** | Dark blue-grey gallery. Bright neutral fabrication cell. Warm material tones on the garment. |

## Scene 08: TERRACE
**Timecode:** 0:46 – 0:52

![Visitor on terrace at night with city below](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/08_terrace_night.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Exterior. Upper floor terrace — a concrete platform projecting from the stacked building mass. The visitor stands at the parapet edge (1m solid concrete, 200mm thick), silhouetted against the city. Behind: the curtain wall of the floor above glows warm, light spilling through vertical mullions onto the dark concrete terrace. The building's offset volumes visible above and below. City lights distant below. |
| **Camera** | Low angle, from terrace floor level, looking up at the visitor against the sky. 35mm anamorphic. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | No camera movement. The visitor turns slowly, looking from the city back toward the building interior. Wind catches their coat. |
| **Lighting** | Warm interior glow from curtain wall behind. Cool ambient sky. City lights below as scattered points. Edge light on the parapet and the visitor's silhouette. |
| **Sound** | Wind. Distant city. The glass behind transmits a faint hum from the interior. Open air after enclosed spaces — the acoustic relief of sky. |
| **Voice-Over** | *(Silence. 3 seconds. Wind, city, breath. The pause before the closing statement.)* |
| **Mood** | Elevation. Between inside and outside. Between the built world and the open world. |
| **Color** | Dark concrete parapet. Warm glass glow. Blue-grey sky. City point lights. |

## Scene 09: PASSAGE
**Timecode:** 0:52 – 0:56

![Floating light frame in vast dark hall](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/09_descent.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A vast dark hall between floors. A large rectangular geometric light frame floats suspended from the ceiling — a glowing white rectangular outline made of thin LED bars, hovering over a raised platform. Fine vertical cables descend from above, barely visible. The visitor stands on the platform beneath the floating frame, small against the enormous space. Atmospheric haze fills the volume, giving the light frame soft halos. The floor is dark, slightly reflective. |
| **Camera** | Wide. Centered. Locked off. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | No camera movement. The visitor stands still beneath the light frame. A moment of pause in the journey. The haze drifts slowly. |
| **Lighting** | The floating light frame is the only source. It defines the space by what it illuminates and what it leaves in darkness. Reflections on the wet floor double the geometry. |
| **Sound** | Near silence. A faint electrical hum from the light frame. The visitor's breathing, barely audible. The space itself resonating at a low frequency. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Performance is not born."* |
| **Mood** | Transition. Between floors, between experiences. A liminal chamber. |
| **Color** | Pure void black. Portal white light frame. Grey haze. |

## Scene 10: DEPARTURE
**Timecode:** 0:56 – 1:00

![Visitor exiting through diamond ceiling entrance](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/10_departure.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Shot from inside the store looking out. The diamond-pattern luminous ceiling above. The frosted glass doors open. The visitor walks away from camera into the evening, carrying a minimal dark bag. The warm interior glow spills out as a rectangle of light on the dark sidewalk. The street beyond is empty. The visitor's silhouette shrinks. The threshold crossed in reverse — from light back into void. |
| **Camera** | Locked off. Centered. Wide. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | The visitor walks away. No camera movement. The figure diminishes. The doors remain open. |
| **Lighting** | Diamond ceiling above — warm white. Interior glow from behind camera. The exterior is dark. The light rectangle on the sidewalk is the building's final gesture. |
| **Sound** | Footsteps transitioning from interior stone to exterior pavement. Acoustic shift — the space opens, reverb dies. Silence builds. Then: a single sustained tone — 220Hz, concert A. Warm, analog. Holds for 3 seconds, then decays to nothing. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"It is engineered."* (1.5s pause) → *"Future your performance."* |
| **Mood** | Departure. The visitor carries something invisible. The threshold behind them. |
| **Color** | Warm interior (#C4A882 walls, white ceiling). Dark exterior. The rectangle of spilled light. |

**End frame:** 1 second of black. Then: "DUNE.X" in Monument Extended Ultrabold, bone-white (#E8E0D4), wide-tracked, centered. 2 seconds later: "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." in Söhne Mono Regular below. Holds 3 seconds. Fades.

### Brand Pillars Mapped to Scenes

| Scene | Brand Pillar | Key Line |
|---|---|---|
| 01 APPROACH | Manifesto | *"We dress the departure."* |
| 02 ENTRANCE | Threshold concept | *"The threshold is not a door."* |
| 03 ATRIUM | Biodata Intelligence | *"The body generates data."* |
| 04 GALLERY | Singular computation | *"Computed for the singular body."* |
| 05 COLLECTION WALL | Membrane Architecture | *"The architecture is transparent."* |
| 06 PRODUCT CHAMBER | Biodata → Form | *"The garment knows you before you wear it."* |
| 07 FABRICATION | Computational Craft | *"Data as material. Computation as craft."* |
| 08 TERRACE | — | *(silence — departure readiness implied)* |
| 09 PASSAGE | Core statement pt.1 | *"Performance is not born."* |
| 10 DEPARTURE | Core statement pt.2 | *"It is engineered."* |
| END | Tagline | *"Future your performance."* |

### Narrative Thread

The VO follows the brand's core philosophy chain:

> **The body generates data → Data reveals patterns → Patterns shape form → Form defines motion**

Each line appears once across scenes 03–06, giving the film a logical progression that doubles as brand philosophy. The manifesto opens the film (*"We dress the departure"*), the core statement closes it (*"Performance is not born. It is engineered."*), and the tagline is the final word.

### Production Approach
- **Scenes 01, 08:** Practical exterior location at dusk/night. The flagship building (Blender model for reference).
- **Scenes 02, 10:** Practical entrance set or LED volume stage. Diamond ceiling is a buildable lighting rig.
- **Scene 03:** LED volume stage with curved screen content. Atmospheric haze practical.
- **Scenes 04, 05:** Practical interior set build — gallery rooms with overhead lighting rigs and mannequin styling.
- **Scene 06:** Practical set with overhead light ring rig + data screen content (real-time generative).
- **Scene 07:** Practical set with two-sided glass wall. Fabrication cell dressed with robotic arm props or real CNC/3D printer.
- **Scene 09:** Large dark stage with suspended LED light frame. Haze machine. Reflective floor treatment.
