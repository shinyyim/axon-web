# DUNE.X Flagship — Materials & Lighting Specification

---

## Material Philosophy

Every surface in the DUNE.X flagship is selected for what it communicates, not what it decorates. Materials must register as engineered, honest, and physically present. No veneers. No laminates. No applied finishes that disguise substrate. What the visitor touches is what the material is — concrete is concrete, steel is steel, plaster is mineral.

The palette is narrow. Five primary materials, deployed across seven floors with controlled variation. Each floor has a dominant surface character. Together, they form a vertical gradient: raw and massive at the base, refined and precise at the top.

## Primary Material Palette

### 1. Board-Formed Concrete

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Pigmented architectural concrete, board-formed |
| **Color** | Dark charcoal — NCS S 8502-B, near-black with blue-grey undertone |
| **Finish** | Board-formed texture (25mm plank pattern), sealed with matte penetrating sealer |
| **Reflectivity** | Very low (5–8% specular) |
| **Application** | B1 walls and ceiling structure. 1F exterior facade. Structural columns where exposed. |
| **Acoustic** | Hard, reflective. Contributes to reverberant character of B1. |
| **Notes** | The board pattern reads as construction language — the mark of the formwork is visible. The concrete is honest about its making. Surface shall be consistent in color but not uniform — natural variation accepted. No patching of minor bugholes. |

### 2. Dark Mineral Plaster

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Lime-based mineral plaster with charcoal pigment |
| **Color** | Near-black matte — comparable to RAL 9011 (Graphite Black) with slight warmth |
| **Finish** | Hand-troweled, matte, micro-textured |
| **Thickness** | 8–12mm applied over substrate |
| **Reflectivity** | Very low (3–5% specular) — the most light-absorbing surface in the building |
| **Application** | 1F airlock corridor walls. 2F walls and partitions. 3F primary wall surfaces. |
| **Acoustic** | Moderately absorptive. Reduces high-frequency reflection. |
| **Notes** | The plaster absorbs light rather than reflecting it, creating the void condition. Hand-troweled application gives each wall a unique surface texture — subtle, barely visible ridges and compressions. This is the brand's primary interior material. Reference: SUB (sub.global) spatial treatments. |

### 3. Blackened Steel

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Hot-rolled mild steel, chemically blackened (patina finish) |
| **Color** | Blue-black to matte black, depending on treatment cycle |
| **Finish** | Oil-rubbed patina. No clear coat. The surface will develop a slight sheen over time from handling. |
| **Reflectivity** | Low-medium (10–15% specular, with directional grain) |
| **Application** | All doors and door frames. Stair treads and handrails. Display pedestal structures. Cafe counter frame. Elevator door faces. Facade entry door. 6F viewing gallery railing. |
| **Thickness** | 3mm plate (doors, panels), 6mm plate (structural elements), 12mm plate (stair treads) |
| **Notes** | Blackened steel is the building's connective tissue — it appears on every floor as hardware, structure, and threshold markers. The patina darkens over time and with handling, creating a surface that records use. Edges are deburred but not rounded — maintain a precision-cut character. |

### 4. Dark Polished Concrete (Floor Finish)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Polished concrete with dark integral pigment |
| **Color** | Near-black with slight aggregate visibility — anthracite tone |
| **Finish** | Honed to 400-grit (satin, not mirror). Sealed with lithium silicate densifier. |
| **Reflectivity** | Medium (15–20% specular). Reflects light sources as soft pools, not sharp reflections. |
| **Application** | B1 floor (with recessed arena zone). 4F floor. Standard floor finish unless otherwise specified. |
| **Notes** | The polished concrete floor creates a base continuity — it appears wherever the building is being straightforwardly structural. The satin finish reflects overhead light as diffused pools, contributing to the sense of depth. |

### 5. Dark Poured Resin

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Self-leveling epoxy resin, pigmented |
| **Color** | Near-black with high-depth appearance — appears bottomless in low light |
| **Finish** | Semi-gloss (30–40% specular). Seamless. |
| **Thickness** | 3–5mm over concrete substrate |
| **Reflectivity** | Medium-high. Reflects point light sources clearly. Creates a mirrored floor effect in darkness. |
| **Application** | 1F floor (airlock corridor and reception). 2F floor. 3F floor. The continuous floor material for the lower narrative floors. |
| **Notes** | The resin floor is the material that tells the visitor they have left the street. It begins at the entry threshold and continues through 1F–3F. Its reflectivity creates depth — in darkness, the floor appears to extend downward, doubling the perceived volume of the space. Footsteps on resin have a distinct sound: muted, clean, almost silent. |

## Secondary Materials

### 6. Sand-Cast Aluminum

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Sand-cast aluminum with natural cast surface |
| **Color** | Raw aluminum grey with cast texture — unpolished, unpainted |
| **Finish** | As-cast, lightly wire-brushed to remove loose mold sand. No anodizing. No coating. |
| **Application** | Furniture frames — bench structures on 3F and 4F. Display hardware. Small fixtures. |
| **Notes** | Sand-cast aluminum carries the mark of its manufacturing — grain pattern from the sand mold, slight surface irregularities, each piece unique. This material represents computational craft made physical — the aluminum is cast from parametric mold forms generated by algorithm. |

### 7. Matte Black Gypsum (4F Only)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Standard gypsum wall panel, painted |
| **Color** | Matte black (comparable to RAL 9005) |
| **Finish** | Level 5 smooth, painted with ultra-matte paint (<2% sheen) |
| **Application** | 4F walls and partitions only |
| **Notes** | The deliberate downgrade from mineral plaster to painted gypsum on 4F signals the floor's functional character. The material shift is subtle but registers subconsciously — the walls feel thinner, lighter, less substantial. This reinforces the conceptual de-escalation of 4F before the re-escalation of 5F. |

### 8. Crushed Basalt Aggregate (5F Only)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Crushed volcanic basalt, graded 5–15mm |
| **Color** | Dark charcoal to black, with occasional crystalline glints |
| **Depth** | 50mm layer over structural slab, contained by flush steel edge strips |
| **Application** | 5F floor — the planetary surface |
| **Notes** | This is the most sensorially disruptive material in the building. After floors of smooth, reflective resin, the visitor steps onto loose crushed rock. The sound changes. The footing changes. The body's relationship to the ground shifts. An accessible pathway (900mm wide) of flush dark resin runs through the aggregate field from elevator to vitrines. |

### 9. Laminated Safety Glass

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | 12mm laminated safety glass, low-iron, anti-reflective coated |
| **Color** | Near-colorless (low-iron eliminates green tint) |
| **Finish** | Both surfaces anti-reflective coated. Edges polished. |
| **Application** | 6F fabrication theater partition. 5F product display domes (borosilicate glass). 2F interactive installation cylinder (acrylic alternative acceptable). |
| **Notes** | Glass in this building is always transparent — never frosted, never tinted, never opaque. Its role is to separate while revealing. The anti-reflective coating ensures the visitor sees through the glass, not at it. |

### 10. Dark Leather

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Full-grain vegetable-tanned leather, dyed |
| **Color** | Near-black with brown undertone (void-adjacent, not true black) |
| **Finish** | Matte, uncoated. Will develop patina with use. |
| **Application** | Seating cushions on 3F and 4F benches. |
| **Notes** | The only organic material in the building. Its warmth is intentional — on the social floor (3F), the leather provides a temperature and texture contrast to the metal and mineral surroundings. Over time, the leather will lighten at contact points, recording the presence of visitors. |

## Floor Finish Schedule

| Floor | Primary Finish | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Dark polished concrete | Recessed arena zone (50mm depression) for installation flush mounting |
| 1F | Dark poured resin | Begins at entry threshold. Seamless through airlock and reception. |
| 2F | Dark poured resin | Continuous with 1F. Same material, same depth-creating reflectivity. |
| 3F | Dark poured resin | Continuous with lower floors. Seating zone: resin under benches, no carpet. |
| 4F | Dark polished concrete | Material shift from resin to concrete signals functional character. |
| 5F | Crushed basalt aggregate | 50mm depth, with 900mm flush resin accessible path. |

## Lighting Design

### Philosophy

Light in the DUNE.X flagship is architectural — it defines space, directs movement, and establishes atmosphere. There is no ambient fill lighting in the building. Every light source is specific, directional, and intentional. The primary illumination strategy: **darkness as default, light as intervention**.

### Color Temperature Gradient

| Floor | Primary CCT | Character |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Variable (event-dependent) | Default: single linear channel at 4000K |
| 1F | 2700K | Warm dim — ankle-level wayfinding strip. Entry condition. |
| 2F | 3500K (ambient), 5000K (scanning ring) | Mixed — warm atmosphere, cold functional light for scanning |
| 3F | 3000K | The warmest floor. The suspended ring and restroom slot emit gentle warmth. |
| 4F | 4000K | Neutral white. Functional. No atmospheric intention. |
| 5F | 5500K (portal ring), none (surround) | Cold white from the portal. The planetary surround provides dim ambient glow. |
| 6F | 5000K (fabrication), 3000K (handoff) | Industrial cold in the theater. A single warm downlight at the handoff counter. |

### Lighting Types

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Recessed linear LED, aluminum channel, opal diffuser |
| **Width** | 12mm visible |
| **Output** | 200–400 lumens/m (very low — directional, not illuminating) |
| **CCT** | 2700K (1F), 3500K (2F–3F), 4000K (4F) |
| **CRI** | 90+ |
| **Mounting** | Floor-recessed at ankle height (80mm above finished floor) |
| **Control** | Dimmable, addressable per segment. Capable of slow pulse (2-second cycle). |
| **Application** | 1F airlock corridor. 2F transition corridor. 4F escalator descent. 5F stair tread edges. |

#### 2. Suspended Light Rings

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Custom fabricated circular LED luminaire |
| **Diameter** | 2.0m (3F), 3.0m (5F) |
| **Profile** | 50mm wide x 30mm deep aluminum extrusion, black anodized exterior, white interior reflector |
| **Output** | 3F: 3,000 lumens total, dimmed to 30% default. 5F: 8,000 lumens total, full intensity. |
| **CCT** | 3F: 3000K. 5F: 5500K. |
| **CRI** | 95+ |
| **Suspension** | Aircraft cable from structural ceiling points, adjustable height. 3F: 3.2m above floor. 5F: 3.8m above floor. |
| **Control** | Dimmable. 5F ring can fade from 0% to 100% over 4 seconds (synchronized with elevator arrival). |
| **Notes** | The 5F ring is the building's primary icon — the portal. Visible from below as a halo. From 5F floor level, it casts a defined circle of light approximately 2.5m in diameter onto the vitrines below. |

#### 3. Scanning Ring (2F)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Flush-mounted circular LED array in ceiling recess |
| **Diameter** | 1.5m |
| **Output** | Standby: 500 lumens (10% intensity). Active scan: 5,000 lumens (100%). |
| **CCT** | 5000K — clinical, precise |
| **CRI** | 97+ (color accuracy critical for scanning) |
| **Mounting** | Recessed in ceiling, flush with surrounding matte black panel |
| **Control** | Triggered by scanning sequence. Ramp: 0% → 100% over 2 seconds at scan start, hold for 45 seconds, 100% → 10% over 3 seconds at completion. |

#### 4. Edge-Lit Display Lighting (5F Vitrines)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Miniature LED strip recessed in pedestal base, directed upward through glass dome |
| **Output** | 150 lumens per vitrine — subtle, not flood-lit |
| **CCT** | 4000K — neutral, accurate |
| **CRI** | 95+ |
| **Notes** | The product is lit from below, creating an uplift glow through the glass dome. The primary illumination on the product comes from the overhead portal ring. The edge-lit base adds definition to the underside and creates a rim glow on the dome. |

#### 5. Fabrication Zone Overhead (6F)

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Linear LED arrays, surface-mounted in continuous rows |
| **Output** | 12,000 lumens total — the brightest zone in the building |
| **CCT** | 5000K — daylight industrial |
| **CRI** | 90+ |
| **Mounting** | Three parallel linear fixtures spanning the 3.5m width of the fabrication zone |
| **Notes** | This light is functional — the robotic arm requires consistent, shadow-free illumination. The brightness contrast between the dark viewing gallery and the lit fabrication zone creates a stage-and-audience condition: the visitor stands in relative darkness, watching a brightly lit performance. |

#### 6. Elevator Interior

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Recessed ceiling panel, edge-lit LED |
| **Output** | Variable: 800 lumens at boarding, dims to 50 lumens during ascent, returns to 400 lumens before doors open |

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Recessed linear LED in wall, behind narrow slot |
| **Width** | 1.2m wide, 3mm visible slot |
| **Output** | 200 lumens — glows, does not illuminate surroundings |
| **CCT** | 4000K |
| **Control** | Steady glow during standby. Brightens (2x intensity) as elevator arrives. |

## Acoustic Treatment

| Floor | Treatment | Target RT60 |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | None (raw concrete). Temporary panels available on wall-mounted anchor points. | 2.0–2.5s (untreated). 0.8–1.0s (with panels). |
| 1F | Mineral plaster provides moderate mid-frequency absorption. Resin floor is reflective. | 1.2–1.5s in corridor. 1.0s in reception. |
| 2F | Ceiling: perforated metal acoustic panels with 50mm black acoustic fleece. Walls: mineral plaster. | 0.6–0.8s. Controlled for biodata audio cues. |
| 3F | Ceiling: acoustic panels. Leather seating absorbs mid-range. Plaster walls absorb minimally. | 0.6–0.8s. Comfortable for conversation. |
| 4F | Gypsum walls, concrete floor — minimal treatment. | 0.8–1.0s. Acceptable for functional space. |
| 5F | Projection substrate (stretched fabric over absorption panel) acts as acoustic treatment on 270-degree surround. Basalt floor scatters sound. | 0.4–0.6s. Creates perceived vastness through rapid decay — sound dies quickly, implying large volume. |
| 6F | Glass partition reflects into gallery. Gallery ceiling: acoustic panels. Fabrication zone: untreated (machine sound is part of the experience). | Gallery: 0.6s. Fabrication: 1.0–1.2s (contained behind glass). |

| 4F | 21 C | 45% | Standard. |
| 5F | 18–19 C | 35% | Deliberately cool and dry. The temperature drop is part of the sensory shift. HVAC supply through floor-level registers concealed in basalt edge strips. |
| 6F | 20 C (gallery), 22 C (fabrication) | 40% (gallery), 35% (fabrication) | Fabrication zone held at precise conditions for material consistency. Isolated HVAC loop. |

*"The material is the message. Concrete says mass. Steel says precision. Plaster says silence. The building does not need to explain itself. You feel it in your hands."*
