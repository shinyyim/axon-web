## Master Shot List

### Scene 01: SIGNAL (0:00 -- 0:08)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | SIGNAL | -- / -- / -- | 2.0s | -- | None | Pure black frame. No image. | None | True silence. No ambience. | -- |
| 02 | SIGNAL | 100mm macro / 40cm (foot level) / Locked, then slow push-in (2mm/s) | 6.0s | 48fps (played at 24fps = 2x slow motion) | No key light. Illumination from VFX biodata overlay only. Faint rim light from below on sole of foot. Cold white. | A bare foot suspended mid-stride against void. Biodata streams radiate from the foot: force distribution filaments, pressure nodes, trajectory trails. Data builds from sparse to dense, forming a wireframe architecture of the movement signature. Foot completes one slow step cycle. | Biodata visualization overlay: procedural force-distribution mapping, pressure-node rendering, trajectory filament trails. Generative, not keyframed. Composited over practical foot photography. | Low subsonic pulse (28Hz) begins at 2.0s. Biodata micro-ticks: dry, metallic, rhythmic. Ticks accelerate and pattern. | 0:05 -- lower-left, Sohne Mono Light 12pt, fade-in 800ms: "The body generates data." |

**Transition to Scene 02:** Match dissolve. The foot and biodata wireframe morph into the parametric data cloud. Duration: 1200ms. The dissolve begins at 0:07.4.

### Scene 02: TRANSLATION (0:08 -- 0:15)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 03 | TRANSLATION | Virtual camera (CG) / Center-frame / 180-degree orbital arc (slow, continuous) | 4.0s | 24fps (CG render) | Self-luminous data cloud (cold white point lights). No external source. | Biodata filaments from Shot 02 compress and reorganize into abstract data field. Parametric cloud of points and vectors rotates in void. Form begins to resolve: lines connect, lattice structure emerges. The Terrain Boot 01 appears as computational ghost -- transparent, structural, every node visible. Boot rotates once. | Full CG sequence. Parametric point cloud, procedural mesh resolution, generative lattice construction. Real-time render (Unreal Engine 5 or Houdini Solaris). | Accelerating biodata ticks compress into dense rhythmic pulse. Low mechanical hum rises (computational processing as sound). | 0:10 -- lower-left, Sohne Mono Light 12pt, cross-fade from previous text 800ms: "Data reveals patterns." |
| 04 | TRANSLATION | Virtual camera (CG) / Center-frame / Hold orbital, slight push-in | 3.0s | 24fps (CG render) | Data cloud self-luminous. Single overhead spotlight fades in (hard white, no fill) as form solidifies. | The parametric cloud collapses into solid geometry. The boot form hardens from translucent data to photorealistic surface. Lattice midsole structure resolves. The bone-white boot is complete, hovering, lit from above. | CG-to-photorealistic transition. Data mesh resolves into product-quality boot render. Material shading: bone-white composite with visible lattice substructure. | At solidification: 0.5s silence. Then single resonant tone -- tuning fork struck on concrete. Warm, metallic, decaying. | -- |

**Transition to Scene 03:** Light wipe. The overhead spotlight on the CG boot expands into a white flash, which resolves into the practical overhead spotlight of the fabrication cell. Duration: 1000ms. Begins at 0:14.5.

---

### Scene 03: FORM (0:15 -- 0:23)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 05 | FORM | 50mm anamorphic / 30cm (boot level) / Lateral tracking L-to-R along fabrication cell | 5.0s | 60fps (played at 24fps = 2.5x slow motion) | Single overhead industrial spotlight: hard white, focused on fabrication zone. Deep shadow elsewhere. Faint warm spill from atrium glow through background glass (regolith #C4A882 warmth). | Robotic arm deposits material onto the Terrain Boot 01 in dark fabrication cell. Boot is mid-construction: outsole and lattice midsole complete (bone-white), upper being printed layer by layer. Camera close enough to see individual filament deposits. Behind fabrication cell, through dark glass: faint glow of flagship atrium below. | Minimal VFX. Subtle data overlay on boot surface for 2 seconds: structural stress indicators, spec readouts in Sohne Mono (faint, translucent). 35mm grain in post. | Servo whir/stop rhythm of robotic arm. Material placement sounds (tiny, precise, tactile). Low resonant tone from Scene 02 continues beneath, barely audible. | 0:18 -- lower-left, Sohne Mono Light 12pt, cross-fade 800ms: "Patterns shape form." |
| 06 | FORM | 50mm anamorphic / 30cm / Tracking pauses, slight reverse (moment of regard) | 3.0s | 60fps | Same overhead spot. Rack focus from robotic arm (foreground, soft) to completed boot section (sharp). | Camera passes the boot, pauses, reverses slightly. A beat of stillness. The robotic arm completes a layer, withdraws. The boot sits in the pool of light. Detail of the lattice structure visible -- each printed node catching the overhead white. | Same subtle overlay, fading out. | Servo stops. Silence except for the low tone. A single material-settling sound: the boot cooling, contracting. | -- |

**Transition to Scene 04:** Cross-dissolve. The overhead spotlight on the boot in the fabrication cell dissolves into the darkness of the airlock corridor. Duration: 1000ms. Begins at 0:22.5.

### Scene 04: THRESHOLD (0:23 -- 0:30)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 07 | THRESHOLD | 35mm anamorphic / 170cm (eye level, descending) / Steadicam forward tracking through airlock | 3.0s | 24fps | Near-total darkness. Faint rim light on concrete airlock walls (cold white, edge only). | Camera moves through narrow concrete airlock corridor (1F entry). Walls close on either side. Darkness ahead. The space begins to open -- the ceiling rises, walls fall away. The first glimpse of the atrium beyond. | Minimal. Subtle atmospheric haze added in post. | Footsteps in airlock -- hard, precise, reverberant. The acoustics shift as the space opens: reverb tail extends, multiplies. Cathedral-scale spatial bloom. | -- |
| 08 | THRESHOLD | 35mm anamorphic / 170cm descending to 30cm / Steadicam approach, camera descends during move | 4.0s | 24fps | Overhead ring light: pure portal white (#FFFFFF), creating a defined circle on the dark floor. Star ceiling above: scattered pinpoint cool-white LEDs. Boot on low black pedestal at center of light ring. | The atrium opens. Vast circular arena revealed. Star ceiling high above. In the center: the completed Terrain Boot 01 on a low black pedestal, inside a ring of portal white light from overhead. The boot is the only object in the space. Camera approaches, descending from eye level to 30cm (boot-level hero shot). Lens flares as it crosses the light ring boundary. Boot fills the frame in final position: low-angle, inside the halo of light, lattice structure casting shadow patterns on the pedestal. | Practical location with subtle haze. Anamorphic lens flare on light ring is practical. Post: contrast enhancement, grain. | Sustained low-frequency hum: the room resonating. Faint high-pitched electrical tone at the threshold of hearing (the light ring's sound). The tone holds, unresolved. | 0:26 -- lower-left, Sohne Mono Light 12pt, cross-fade 800ms: "Form defines motion." |

**Transition to Scene 05:** Cross-dissolve. The hero shot of the boot on the pedestal dissolves into the same boot in motion on a foot. Match on the boot's profile. Duration: 1200ms. Begins at 0:29.4.

### Scene 05: BODY (0:30 -- 0:38)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09 | BODY | 85mm anamorphic / 20cm rising to 60cm / Tracking alongside, rising crane-up | 4.0s | 72fps (played at 24fps = 3x slow motion) | Hard edge light from camera-right: white, catching boot surface and rim of the figure. Background is pure void. | Low camera, focused on boots in motion. Figure walks in profile on dark stage (B1 runway). Terrain Boot 01 with dark technical trousers. Lattice midsole flexes with each step. Engineered tread contacts dark surface. Camera tracks at walking speed, rising from boot level. | Possible subtle biodata overlay on boot sole during ground contact: faint force-distribution lines linking back to Scene 01. 2 seconds, then fades. | Footsteps: the Terrain Boot 01's specific sound -- engineered tread on hard stage, precise mechanical contact. | -- |
| 10 | BODY | 85mm anamorphic / 60cm rising to 120cm / Continuing crane-up, same tracking speed | 2.5s | 72fps | Same edge light from camera-right, now catching more of the figure. Membrane coat panels catch rim light. | Camera continues rising to reveal the full figure. Bone-white membrane shell coat visible, transparent panels catching edge light. Structural lines of the garment respond to the stride. Face in profile, never fully revealed. The figure is architecture, not personality. | None. Practical photography only. | Fabric movement of membrane coat. Human breath, barely audible beneath the footsteps. | -- |
| 11 | BODY | 85mm anamorphic / 120cm / Tracking continues, holds height | 1.5s | 72fps | Same edge light + Signal Red portal: a vertical bar of #E94520 light, 30cm wide, positioned in the figure's path. Practical light rig. | The figure passes through a vertical slit of Signal Red light. The red catches the boot's surface, the coat's membrane, the figure's silhouette. 1.2 seconds of red illumination. Then gone. The figure continues into darkness. The only color in the film. | None. Practical red light portal. Post: ensure Signal Red maintains full saturation (#E94520, 100%) while everything else remains desaturated. | At the moment of red portal crossing: a single deep pulse, felt in the chest (sub-bass hit, 40Hz, 200ms). Then silence returns. | -- |

**Transition to Scene 06:** Natural light fade-out. The figure walks into the far darkness of the stage, shrinking, disappearing. No dissolve -- the darkness absorbs them. Duration: 2000ms. Begins at 0:37.0.

---

### Scene 06: DEPARTURE (0:38 -- 0:45)

| Shot | Scene | Lens / Height / Movement | Duration | Frame Rate | Lighting | Subject / Action | VFX Requirements | Sound Cue | On-screen Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | DEPARTURE | -- / -- / Locked, centered | 2.0s | 24fps | None. Near-total black. Faintest trace of stage edge lighting decaying. | Empty dark space. The figure is gone. The stage is vacant. Hold on darkness. | None. | All sound drops. True silence. 2 seconds. No ambience, no tone, no room sound. Digital silence. | -- |
| 13 | DEPARTURE | -- / -- / Locked, centered | 2.5s | 24fps | Soft overhead wash, illuminating only the text area. As if a light portal opened above the letters. Rest of frame: void. | "DUNE.X" materializes from the darkness. Not animated in -- revealed, as if the light is only now reaching it. Monument Extended Ultrabold, bone-white (#E8E0D4), wide-tracked (+100). The period is the last element to appear. 1.5 seconds after wordmark: "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." resolves below in Sohne Mono Regular. | Wordmark reveal: light pass from center outward (800ms). The light "finds" the letters. Subtle, mechanical, not theatrical. Tagline fade-in: 600ms, standard opacity. | As wordmark appears: single sustained tone (220Hz, concert A). Warm, analog. Resolves slowly. | "DUNE.X" -- Monument Extended Ultrabold, centered, bone-white (#E8E0D4), +100 tracking. |
| 14 | DEPARTURE | -- / -- / Locked, centered | 2.5s | 24fps | Same overhead wash, steady. | Wordmark and tagline hold. Still. Then begin to fade -- not to black, but the light above dims, as if the portal is closing. The letters recede into darkness. End on black. | Light dim: 1200ms fade. | Tone decays to silence over 2.5 seconds. End on true silence. | "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." -- Sohne Mono Regular, centered below wordmark, bone-white, +20 tracking. |
