## 2. Brand Vision

DUNE.X is a future apparel laboratory that designs clothing at the threshold between known and unknown. Technical fashion forged in darkness, shaped by light, and worn by those who have already decided to leave. The brand exists in the void: the space between departure and arrival, where the body needs a second architecture.

Every garment begins with the body's own data. DUNE.X captures biometric signals — movement patterns, force distribution, cadence, breath — and transforms them into engineered structure through AI. The body generates data. Data reveals patterns. Patterns shape form. Form defines motion.

Performance is not born. It is engineered.

Like a rhapsody built from fragments of rhythm and force, each DUNE.X piece is composed from the individual's biodata — not designed for the average, but computed for the singular. This is not wearable technology. It is technology that becomes wearable architecture.

People who wear DUNE.X are not waiting for the future. They are dressing for it now.

## 3. Target Consumer

### Primary: The Departure Candidate
22–38. Creative technologists, architects, researchers, designers, engineers. Post-national, tech-literate, design-sensitive. They follow SpaceX launches, read Dezeen, and wear SCRY, Acronym, or Post Archive Faction. They move between dark venues, research labs, and screens. They understand that clothing is an interface between body and environment — and they believe that interface should be intelligent.

They are drawn to DUNE.X because it treats the body as a data source, not a mannequin. They want garments that respond to how they move, not just how they look.

**Spending:** $200–800 per piece. Drop-based, intentional. They buy into systems, not trends.

### Secondary: The Experience Tourist
Design-forward consumers captivated by the world-building. They come for the flagship store as a theatrical experience — dark arenas, light portals, garments displayed as specimens — and buy into the aesthetic as personal identity expression. Less interested in the biodata engineering, more drawn to the visual world and the feeling of standing at the threshold.

## 4. Brand Values

1. **Biodata Intelligence** — Every piece begins with the body's own signal. Movement, force, cadence, breath — captured and translated into structure by AI. The garment knows you before you wear it.
2. **Departure Ready** — The first apparel you pack for the Moon. The first shoes that touch Mars. Engineered for that moment — not as costume, but as the real thing.
3. **Computational Craft** — Generative patterns, parametric structures, 3D-printed components. Data as material. Algorithms as tailors. The digital is visible.
4. **Membrane Architecture** — Transparent shells, layered membranes, structural skins. The garment as second body — visible, technical, honest.
5. **Collective Curiosity** — For the curious, not the exclusive. Selective, not elitist.

## 5. Competitive Position

DUNE.X owns the intersection that no competitor occupies: **AI-driven biodata engineering + theatrical brand world**.

- SCRY has lab-culture but no intelligence layer — their process is computational, not responsive.
- Acronym has function but no data feedback loop — their garments are designed for bodies in general, not your body.
- Gentle Monster has experiential retail but no technical product depth.
- Nike and Adidas have biodata R&D but package it as mass-market sportswear, not engineered architecture.

DUNE.X is the only brand where biometric input shapes the garment, and the garment lives inside a world of void, light, and threshold.

**Key competitors:** SCRY, Acronym, Balenciaga, Nike ACG, Post Archive Faction, Gentle Monster, Reindee Lusion.

## 6. Reference DNA

| Reference | What We Take |
|---|---|
| [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) | Monolithic black aesthetic, engineering-as-design ethos, mission-driven narrative |
| [Gentle Monster](https://www.gentlemonster.com/) | Experiential retail as art installation, theatrical product display, surreal storytelling |
| [SCRY](https://scccccry.com/) | 3D-printed "digital embryo" manufacturing, footwear-as-research, prototype culture |
| [SUB](https://sub.global/) | Immersive architectural scenography, Balenciaga retail language, raw material honesty |
| [Tamburins](https://www.tamburins.com/en/) | "Anomalous beauty" positioning, curated object sensibility, sensory brand experience |

## 7. Visual Identity Summary

- **Colors:** Void (#0A0A0C), Bone (#E8E0D4), Signal (#E94520). Light as accent — white rings, portals, edge glow.
- **Typography:** Monument Extended (display), Söhne Mono (tech), Neue Montreal (body)
- **Logo:** Typographic wordmark, all caps, wide-tracked. Period between DUNE and X is the visual signature.
- **Photography:** Theatrical darkness + architectural light. Single figures on vast dark stages. Transparent garments catching edge light. Data overlays on material surfaces. Never natural landscape, never lifestyle.
- **Tone:** Clinical Poet — formal, restrained awe, precise, fragments allowed. Never hype.

## 8. Flagship Spatial Program

### Spatial Reference
> **https://sub.global/** — Primary inspiration for spatial language, materiality, circulation, and experiential sequencing.

### Building Configuration
- **6 upper levels + 1 basement**
- **Total height:** 30m (5m per floor)
- **Construction:** New build
- Total area: ~2,600 sqft

### Program Summary

| Program Type | Area (sqft) |
|---|---|
| Public Retail & Display | 1,650 |
| Cultural Event & Lounge | 350 |
| Back of House & Support | 350 |
| Circulation | 250 |

### Circulation Narrative

| Floor | Program | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** | Event Floor | Fashion shows, launches, installations |
| **1F** | Arrival | Airlock entry, threshold from street to void |
| **2F** | Experience Zone | Biodata scanning, AI visualization, brand immersion |
| **3F** | Cafe & Gathering | Social space, lounge — elevator to 5F departs here |
| **4F** | Checkout | Pickup, packaging — least conceptual floor. Escalator/stairs down to 1F exit |
| **5F** | The Reveal | Elevator opens to planetary environment — emotional peak |
| **6F** | Manufacturing | Watch your garment being fabricated by robots, receive your piece |

### Key Decisions (Confirmed)
- **6F Manufacturing:** Real on-site robotic fabrication (not theatrical display)
- **Biodata Scan (2F):** Optional experience, not mandatory for purchase
- **Hero Product:** Terrain Boot 01 (shoe-first launch, full system reveal follows)
- **Commercial Film:** 45-second master cut
- **Building:** 30m total, 5m per floor, new build

*Detailed zoning, spatial planning, and experiential sequencing to be developed by the Spatial Design agent.*

## 9. Deliverables Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Complete)
- Brand strategy & positioning
- Visual identity system (colors, type, logo direction, photography)
- Brand website v1 (landing page with design system)

### Phase 2 — Build (In Progress)
- Commercial film production (storyboard, shot list, motion specs) → `film/`
- Retail flagship store (spatial design, floor plan, materials, lighting) → `spatial/`
- Brand website refinement (product pages, e-commerce structure) → `web/`
- Moodboard & storyboard (to be developed by agent teams)
