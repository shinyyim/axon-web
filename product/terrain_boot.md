## Concept

The first shoe engineered from the act of walking.

Terrain Boot 01 is not designed. It is generated. A 120-second walk and 60-second run on a pressure-plate treadmill produces a complete gait profile: strike pattern, force distribution, pronation angle, cadence rhythm, toe-off dynamics. AI processes this data into a computational lattice sole — a structure where every cell density, wall thickness, and tread node is determined by how one specific body moves across one specific surface.

No two units are identical. Each sole is a topographic map of a singular gait, rendered as 3D-printed architecture. SCRY calls this the digital embryo. We call it what it is: a shoe that knows the foot before the foot knows the shoe.

## Construction Architecture

### Overview

The Terrain Boot 01 is a 4-component assembly:

1. **Computational Lattice Sole** — 3D-printed TPU lattice, biodata-driven geometry
2. **Semi-Translucent Upper** — TPU film + computational knit composite
3. **Structural Cage** — Rigid exoskeletal frame bonded to upper
4. **Internal Last** — Biodata-shaped foot cradle with pressure-responsive zones

### Component 01: Computational Lattice Sole

The sole is the hero component. It is the direct physical output of the customer's gait data.

**Structure:**
- **Material:** Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), SLS 3D-printed
- **Architecture:** Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice — gyroid variant
- **Cell count:** 2,400–3,800 cells per sole (varies by foot size and gait complexity)
- **Cell size range:** 4mm–12mm diameter
- **Wall thickness range:** 0.6mm–1.8mm
- **Total sole height:** 32mm at heel, 18mm at forefoot (base profile, modified per individual)

**What biodata controls:**
| Gait Parameter | Lattice Response |
|---|---|
| Heel strike force (N) | Heel cell density and wall thickness — higher force = denser lattice |
| Midfoot pressure distribution | Arch support topology — maps pressure gradient to cell size gradient |
| Pronation angle (degrees) | Medial/lateral asymmetry in cell orientation — corrective geometry |
| Toe-off force vector | Forefoot energy return geometry — cell orientation aligns with push-off vector |
| Cadence (steps/min) | Overall lattice stiffness tuning — higher cadence = more responsive structure |
| Body weight (kg) | Global density scaling — ensures consistent compression ratio across body types |

**What stays fixed (does not change per customer):**
- Outsole tread node positions (30 tread contact points in fixed grid)
- Overall sole silhouette and perimeter profile
- Midsole-to-outsole bonding interface geometry
- Material (TPU, SLS process)
- Color (Void or Bone — customer selects)

**Tread geometry:**
- 30 tread contact nodes on the outsole surface
- Node size: 6mm diameter hemispheres
- Node depth variation: 2mm–4mm, mapped from pressure distribution data
- High-pressure zones receive deeper, wider nodes for grip
- Low-pressure zones receive shallow nodes — material reduction, weight saving
- Tread pattern is unique per unit but follows a fixed nodal grid

**Finish:**
- Void colorway: Matte black TPU, micro-texture surface (60-grit equivalent)
- Bone colorway: Natural off-white TPU, smooth finish with subtle translucency at thin-wall cells

### Component 02: Semi-Translucent Upper

The upper reveals the boot's internal architecture. It is a membrane, not a shell — the foot is visible as a silhouette through the material.

**Construction:**
- **Outer layer:** 0.4mm TPU film, thermoformed to foot last profile
- **Inner layer:** Computational knit — variable-density knit structure providing stretch zones, support zones, and ventilation
- **Bonding:** Ultrasonic welded at 47 seam points (no thread, no adhesive visible)
- **Transparency:** 40–60% visible light transmission depending on stretch state
- **Height:** Mid-cut, 142mm from sole to collar (ankle coverage)

**Knit zones:**
| Zone | Knit Density | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Toe box | Medium (180 g/m2) | Protection + flex allowance |
| Midfoot lateral | High (240 g/m2) | Structural support, lateral stability |
| Midfoot medial | Medium-high (210 g/m2) | Support with slight flex for pronation |
| Heel cup | High (260 g/m2) | Lockdown, Achilles stability |
| Collar | Low (140 g/m2) | Comfort, breathability, ease of entry |
| Tongue zone | Low (120 g/m2) | Maximum ventilation, flex |

**Color:**
- Void: Smoke-black TPU film over charcoal knit. The lattice sole is visible as dark geometry through the membrane.
- Bone: Frosted off-white TPU film over pale grey knit. The lattice sole glows faintly through the membrane under direct light.

### Component 03: Structural Cage

An exoskeletal frame that provides torsional rigidity and visual identity. The cage is the boot's silhouette — the recognizable geometry seen from distance.

**Construction:**
- **Material:** Glass-filled nylon (PA12-GF), injection molded
- **Profile:** 5 lateral ribs + 2 medial ribs, connected by a heel counter ring and a forefoot bridge
- **Rib width:** 8mm
- **Rib height (proud of upper surface):** 3mm
- **Attachment:** Heat-staked to upper at 14 anchor points
- **Finish:** Matte, color-matched to upper (Void or Bone)

**Design intent:**
The cage reads as architecture. From a distance, the boot has visible structural lines — not decorative, but load-bearing geometry that distributes forces from the upper to the sole. The cage creates the "second skeleton" visual that defines DUNE.X footwear.

### Component 04: Internal Last

The foot cradle that sits between foot and sole. Shaped from biodata.

**Construction:**
- **Material:** Dual-density EVA foam, CNC-milled from biodata profile
- **Top layer:** 4mm open-cell EVA (soft contact layer, moisture-wicking)
- **Base layer:** 8mm closed-cell EVA (structural, shaped to pressure map)
- **Profile:** Shaped to individual foot contour from 3D scan, with pressure-relief channels cut at high-force zones

**What biodata controls:**
- Arch height and curvature — matched to scanned arch profile
- Heel cup depth — matched to calcaneus geometry
- Metatarsal relief channels — positioned at scanned pressure peaks
- Toe spring angle — matched to individual toe-off biomechanics

## Biodata Integration

### The Scan (10 minutes)

The customer visits 2F of the flagship store. The scanning station consists of:

1. **Pressure-plate treadmill** — 2m belt with embedded force sensors (1,024 sensor array, 200Hz sampling rate)
2. **Structured-light 3D scanner** — Captures foot geometry in 8 seconds (0.1mm accuracy)
3. **High-speed camera array** — 4 cameras at 240fps capturing ankle and knee kinematics

**Protocol:**
| Step | Duration | Data Captured |
|---|---|---|
| Static stand | 30s | Weight distribution, arch profile, foot geometry |
| Barefoot walk (3.5 km/h) | 120s | Gait cycle: heel strike, midstance, toe-off. Pressure map per step. Cadence. Pronation angle. |
| Barefoot run (8 km/h) | 60s | Dynamic force amplification, impact pattern shift, cadence under load |
| 3D foot scan (stationary) | 30s | Complete foot surface geometry — 0.1mm resolution point cloud |
| Kinematics capture | Concurrent | Ankle flexion range, knee tracking, tibial rotation |

Total raw data per customer: ~2.4GB
Processed biodata profile: ~18MB parametric file

### AI Processing (24 hours)

The biodata profile is processed through three algorithmic stages:

**Stage 1: Pattern Recognition (2 hours)**
- Gait cycle segmentation and averaging across 80+ walking steps and 40+ running steps
- Pressure map generation: per-step force distribution averaged into a single composite pressure topology
- Pronation classification: neutral, mild overpronation, moderate overpronation, underpronation
- Cadence and timing profile extraction

**Stage 2: Lattice Generation (18 hours)**
- Pressure topology mapped to TPMS cell parameters
- Cell density optimization: iterative FEA simulation (8 rounds) balancing cushioning, energy return, and weight
- Tread node depth mapping from pressure distribution
- Global stiffness tuning from body weight and cadence
- Output: complete lattice geometry as .STL file, ready for print

**Stage 3: Last Shaping (4 hours)**
- 3D foot scan converted to internal last profile
- Pressure-relief channels positioned at top-5 force concentration points
- Arch contour extracted and smoothed for CNC toolpath
- Output: insole geometry as .STEP file, ready for CNC milling

### Manufacturing (3-5 days)

| Step | Process | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Lattice sole print | SLS 3D printing, TPU powder | 18–24 hours (batch of up to 6 soles) |
| Sole post-processing | Powder removal, surface finishing, quality inspection | 4 hours |
| Knit upper production | Computational knitting, pre-programmed zone map | 2 hours per pair |
| TPU film thermoforming | Vacuum-formed over upper on last | 45 minutes |
| Ultrasonic welding | Film-to-knit bonding at 47 points | 30 minutes |
| Cage bonding | Heat-staking exoskeletal cage to upper assembly | 20 minutes |
| Insole CNC milling | Dual-density EVA, 3-axis CNC | 40 minutes per pair |
| Final assembly | Sole-to-upper bonding (urethane adhesive, heat-activated) | 1 hour |
| Quality inspection | Dimensional check, flex test, visual inspection | 30 minutes |
| Packaging | Specimen Container 01 or standard DUNE.X box | 10 minutes |

**Total manufacturing time per pair:** 28–32 hours of active process time, distributed across 3-5 calendar days depending on print queue.

**All manufacturing occurs at 6F of the flagship store.** The customer can observe the process through viewing windows during their pickup visit.

## The Digital Embryo

Before the physical boot exists, it exists as data.

The digital embryo is the complete parametric model of the customer's Terrain Boot 01 — lattice geometry, upper zone map, insole contour, cage placement — living as a computational file derived from the body's own signal. It is the boot in its pre-material state. Data that has already decided to become an object.

This digital embryo is stored in the customer's DUNE.X profile. It can be:
- Visualized as a rotating 3D model accessible via the web platform
- Used to generate replacement insoles without a new scan
- Referenced for future DUNE.X products (the gait data informs Transit Shell panel placement)
- Updated with a new scan to track biomechanical changes over time

The digital embryo is the customer's biodata signature, rendered as architecture. It belongs to them.

## Dimensions and Weight

| Specification | Value (Men's Frame 04 reference) |
|---|---|
| Length (outsole) | 305mm |
| Width (forefoot, widest) | 112mm |
| Height (sole to collar) | 174mm |
| Sole height (heel) | 32mm |
| Sole height (forefoot) | 18mm |
| Weight per shoe | 340–380g (varies by lattice density) |
| Weight per pair | 680–760g |

Weight target: under 400g per shoe. The lattice sole achieves this through topological optimization — material exists only where force demands it. Empty space is structural, not wasteful.

## Colorways

### Void

The default. The boot disappears into darkness and reveals itself only under edge light.

- **Sole:** Matte black TPU lattice. Under rim light, the lattice cells cast internal shadows that create depth and dimensionality. The sole appears solid from distance, cellular up close.
- **Upper:** Smoke-black TPU film over charcoal computational knit. The film has a faint sheen — not glossy, but reflective enough to catch a single light source. The knit beneath is visible as a subtle texture through the membrane.
- **Cage:** Matte black glass-filled nylon. The ribs read as dark lines against the semi-transparent upper — structural veins.
- **Insole:** Black EVA with debossed DUNE.X period mark at heel.
- **Hardware:** Black sand-cast aluminum eyelet rings (4 per side), black waxed Dyneema lacing.

### Bone

The specimen. The boot under laboratory light. Every internal structure visible.

- **Sole:** Off-white TPU lattice. Translucent at thin-wall cells — light passes through the sole, making the lattice architecture fully legible. Under strong light, the sole glows.
- **Upper:** Frosted off-white TPU film over pale grey computational knit. High transparency — the foot's silhouette is visible inside the boot. The knit zones read as density variations: lighter at ventilation zones, denser at support zones.
- **Cage:** Off-white glass-filled nylon. The ribs appear as skeletal structure over the translucent upper — the boot's exoskeleton.
- **Insole:** Off-white EVA with debossed DUNE.X period mark at heel.
- **Hardware:** Brushed aluminum eyelet rings (4 per side), off-white waxed Dyneema lacing.

## Care and Maintenance

- **Sole:** Wipe with damp cloth. Compressed air to clear lattice cells of debris. Do not submerge — trapped water in lattice cells is difficult to evacuate.
- **Upper:** Wipe with damp microfiber cloth. TPU film can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol for stubborn marks. Do not machine wash.
- **Cage:** Wipe clean. Glass-filled nylon is impact-resistant but not indestructible — avoid sustained point loads on individual ribs.
- **Insole:** Remove and air dry after extended wear. Replace insole via DUNE.X service (uses original biodata profile, no rescan needed).
- **Lacing:** Dyneema lacing is non-stretch and abrasion-resistant. Replace via DUNE.X service kit.
- **Storage:** Store in Specimen Container 01 or flat, away from direct UV. TPU film can yellow under prolonged UV exposure.
