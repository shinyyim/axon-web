# DUNE.X — Moodboard Brief

*"Future your Performance."*

## Board 01: Brand Atmosphere

### Mars Arrival

**Rationale:** The foundational image of the brand. A single human figure dwarfed by Martian dune formations — this is the emotional core of DUNE.X. The brand lives in the vast emptiness between departure and arrival. Warm iron-oxide tones define our color palette.

### Transit Interior

**Rationale:** The interior world of transit — the space between Earth and destination. A single shaft of amber light cutting through dust particles establishes both the lighting language (dramatic, singular source) and the emotional register (solitude, anticipation, the beauty of engineered spaces).

### First Sight

**Rationale:** The moment of arrival — seeing the ground you're about to walk on. This image drives the "departure ready" value pillar. Everything DUNE.X makes is designed for this moment: the transition from viewing to stepping onto new ground.

## Board 02: Product World

### Transit Shell (Outerwear)
![Parametric membrane jacket with 3D-printed structural elements](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_product_01_1771526086781.png)

**Rationale:** The hero product silhouette. Parametric cut panels, translucent membrane layers, sealed seam architecture, and 3D-printed structural shoulder elements. The jacket exists between armor and garment — protection that is also poetic.

### Terrain Footwear
![3D-printed computational lattice shoe](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_product_02_1771526115089.png)

**Rationale:** Footwear as research specimen. The computational lattice structure is visible through the semi-translucent upper, revealing the engineering beneath. This shoe looks grown, not manufactured — a "digital embryo" approach inspired by SCRY's methodology.

### Full Ensemble
![Complete DUNE.X outfit with structured coat and utility trousers](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_product_03_1771526133673.png)

**Rationale:** The full system — outerwear, base layers, and footwear working together. The parametric seam lines create visual continuity across pieces. Color palette in action: bone white primary with charcoal structure and functional details.

### Accessories System
![Parametric backpack, geometric sunglasses, and cylindrical container](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_product_04_1771526311915.png)

**Rationale:** The brand extends beyond clothing into objects. The faceted panel construction language carries across bag, eyewear, and container — creating a unified "mission kit" aesthetic. These are objects you'd pack for departure.

## Board 03: Retail Space

### Flagship Interior
![Cathedral-like retail space with sculptural light installations](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_retail_01_1771526150920.png)

**Rationale:** The flagship store as immersive experience — inspired by Gentle Monster's art-installation retail and SUB's architectural scenography. Massive translucent membrane sculptures hang from the ceiling, casting warm amber light. Products are displayed as specimens on minimal pedestals. The space itself tells the brand story.

### Airlock Entry
![Concrete corridor with LED floor strips leading to light](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_retail_02_1771526174893.png)

**Rationale:** The threshold experience. Entering a DUNE.X store should feel like transitioning through an airlock — leaving the ordinary world and entering the brand universe. Narrow concrete corridors, floor-level light strips, and a warm glow at the threshold create anticipation.

## Board 04: Campaign Tone

### The Departure
![Lone figure walking across vast salt flat in structured coat](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_campaign_01_1771526204497.png)

**Rationale:** This is the campaign image language. Single figure. Immense landscape. Walking away from camera toward the unknown. The wind catches translucent fabric panels. The mood is solitary, purposeful — not lonely, but chosen solitude. "Future your Performance" made visual.

### The Face
![Close-up portrait partially obscured by membrane hood](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_campaign_02_1771526223903.png)

**Rationale:** The intimate counterpoint to the vast landscape shots. Clinical, mysterious, the garment partially concealing the face — the product becomes identity. Chiaroscuro lighting, medium format grain, monochrome treatment. Fashion photography meeting astronaut portraiture.

## Board 05: Material & Typography

### Computational Textile
![Extreme macro of 3D-printed bone-white lattice structure](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_detail_01_1771526241235.png)

**Rationale:** The material language at microscopic scale. This lattice structure — organic yet engineered — is the visual DNA that recurs across products, graphics, and space design. It becomes a pattern, a texture, a philosophy made tangible.

### Brand Typography
![DUNE.X wordmark with "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE" tagline](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/moodboard/mood_typography_01_1771526293409.png)

**Rationale:** The wordmark in its primary expression. Wide-tracked geometric sans-serif, bone on void. The period between DUNE and X creates the mechanical pause — a breath before the unknown. The tagline sits below in monospaced type, clinical and declarative.
