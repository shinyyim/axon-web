## Collection Identity

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Collection** | DEPARTURE 001 |
| **Season** | Post-seasonal. Launch when ready. |
| **Concept** | The first complete system for transit. Seven pieces engineered from biodata, manufactured on-site, designed for the body that has decided to leave. |
| **Hero Product** | TERRAIN BOOT 01 |
| **Launch Sequence** | Shoe-first, then full system reveal |

## Naming System

All DUNE.X products follow **mission-log format** — functional name, sequential numbering. No marketing language. No adjectives. The name tells you what the object does and where it falls in sequence.

**Format:** `[FUNCTION] [TYPE] [SEQUENCE]`

Examples:
- TERRAIN BOOT 01
- TRANSIT SHELL 01
- SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01

**Rules:**
- Always ALL CAPS
- Always two words + two-digit number
- Function word describes the operational context (TERRAIN, TRANSIT, SIGNAL)
- Type word describes the object category (BOOT, SHELL, PACK)
- Sequence number is zero-padded (01, 02, 03)
- No version suffixes, no sub-models, no colorway in the product name

## 7-Piece Lineup

| # | Product Name | Category | Custom / Standard | Price Tier | Biodata Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | **TERRAIN BOOT 01** | Footwear | Custom | $480–620 | Gait analysis, pressure mapping |
| 02 | **TRANSIT SHELL 01** | Outerwear | Custom | $680–840 | 3D body scan, thermal map, ROM |
| 03 | **SIGNAL LAYER 01** | Base Layer | Standard | $180–220 | None (sized via Frame grid) |
| 04 | **TRANSIT PACK 01** | Bag | Standard | $320–380 | None (generative pattern from aggregated data) |
| 05 | **VISOR 01** | Eyewear | Semi-Custom | $280–340 | Face scan for fit adjustment |
| 06 | **SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01** | Hard Case | Standard | $140–180 | None |
| 07 | **DATUM BAND 01** | Wrist Interface | Standard | $220–260 | None (biodata capture device) |

### Custom vs. Standard

- **Custom** pieces require in-store biodata capture. The product is computed from the individual's scan data. No two units are identical. Manufacturing occurs on-site at 6F. Lead time: 3-7 days.
- **Semi-Custom** pieces use a single scan point (face geometry for eyewear) to adjust fit parameters within a fixed structural design. Lead time: 1-2 days.
- **Standard** pieces are produced in the Frame size grid. No scan required. Available for immediate purchase. Generative surface patterns on standard pieces are derived from aggregated, anonymized biodata from previous customers — the collective data shapes the pattern language.

## Size System

### Custom Pieces (Terrain Boot 01, Transit Shell 01)

No traditional sizing. The body is the template.

Each custom product is generated from a unique biodata profile captured during the scanning experience at 2F. The AI processes the scan into manufacturing parameters. The output is a singular unit built for one body.

**Identifier format:** `DX-[PRODUCT CODE]-[UNIQUE ID]`
Example: `DX-TB01-4729` (Terrain Boot 01, unit 4729)

### Standard Pieces (Signal Layer, Transit Pack, Specimen Container, Datum Band)

Standard pieces use the **Frame** sizing system — a dimensional grid based on body measurements, not S/M/L abstraction.

| Frame | Chest (cm) | Waist (cm) | Hip (cm) | Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frame 01 | 82–86 | 66–70 | 86–90 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 02 | 87–91 | 71–75 | 91–95 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 03 | 92–96 | 76–80 | 96–100 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 04 | 97–101 | 81–85 | 101–105 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 05 | 102–106 | 86–90 | 106–110 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 06 | 107–112 | 91–96 | 111–116 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 07 | 113–118 | 97–102 | 117–122 | Base layer, outerwear |
| Frame 08 | 119–124 | 103–108 | 123–128 | Base layer, outerwear |

Frame sizing is gender-neutral. The body is a set of dimensions, not a category.

### Semi-Custom Pieces (Visor 01)

Base structural design is fixed. Fit parameters (temple width, nose bridge depth, lens angle) are adjusted from face-scan data within defined tolerances.

## Colorway System

All DEPARTURE 001 colorways are named from the DUNE.X palette. No seasonal color names. No marketing language. The color name is the material condition.

| Colorway | Hex Reference | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Void** | #0A0A0C | Near-black. The absence before the portal. Carbon-dark surfaces with subtle depth variation under edge light. |
| **Bone** | #E8E0D4 | Off-white. The color of light reflected off structure. Warm neutral that reads as architectural white in darkness. |
| **Signal** | #E94520 | Red-orange. Reserved for limited-edition accent applications only. Never full-garment. Applied at 5% surface area maximum. |
| **Haze** | #2A2A30 | Dark grey. The color between Void and visible. For linings, internal structures, secondary surfaces. |

### Colorway Rules

- Launch colorways: **Void** and **Bone** only
- Signal colorway: released 60 days post-launch as limited accent edition (partial application on heel counter, collar, or zipper pull only)
- Haze is structural — used for interior surfaces, not as a primary exterior colorway
- No seasonal or trend-driven colors. The palette is permanent.
- All custom pieces are available in both Void and Bone. Customer selects at time of scan.

## Drop Strategy

### Sequence: Shoe-First Launch

DEPARTURE 001 does not release as a traditional collection drop. It reveals in stages, building from a single product outward to the full system.

| Phase | Name | Timeline | Products Released | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | TEASE | T-60 days | None. Terrain Boot 01 teaser imagery and biodata visualization footage. No product shots. | Digital only: social, web, dark ambient screen |
| **Phase 2** | REVEAL | T-30 days | TERRAIN BOOT 01 fully revealed. Pre-order opens for in-store scan appointments. | Web reveal + flagship 2F scanning appointments |
| **Phase 3** | SYSTEM | T-0 (Launch Day) | Full DEPARTURE 001 collection revealed. All 7 pieces visible. Standard pieces available immediately. Custom pieces by appointment. | Flagship all floors active. Web catalog live. |
| **Phase 4** | FLAGSHIP | T+14 days | Flagship fully operational. 6F manufacturing running. Event programming begins at B1. | Physical retail + event calendar |

### Phase 1: TEASE (T-60)

No product photography. Only:
- Close-up footage of biodata capture (pressure maps, gait visualization, body scan point clouds)
- Abstract renders of computational lattice generation
- Text overlays: product name, "DEPARTURE 001", scan appointment dates
- Distributed as 15-second loops across social and ambient displays

The product is implied. The data is shown. The body is the subject, not the shoe.

### Phase 2: REVEAL (T-30)

The Terrain Boot 01 is shown in full. Campaign imagery follows photography direction: single boot on dark void, lit by edge light. Transparent sole structure visible. Data overlay showing the biodata that generated the lattice.

Pre-order: customers book scan appointments at the flagship 2F. No online-only purchase for custom pieces.

### Phase 3: SYSTEM (T-0)

Full collection reveal. All 7 pieces shown as a system. Campaign shifts from single product to full-body editorial: a figure in the complete DEPARTURE 001 system — Transit Shell, Signal Layer, Terrain Boot, Transit Pack, Visor, Datum Band — standing at a light portal.

Standard pieces available for immediate purchase in-store and online. Custom pieces available by scan appointment.

### Phase 4: FLAGSHIP (T+14)

The flagship store is the final product. All floors operational. Manufacturing visible at 6F. Event programming launches at B1 with biodata visualization installations, movement workshops, and designer presentations.

## Marketing Position

DEPARTURE 001 is not a collection. It is a system.

Every piece relates to every other piece. The Transit Shell accommodates the Transit Pack's attachment points. The Terrain Boot's sole lattice generates the pattern language applied to the Specimen Container. The Datum Band captures the biodata that will shape the next collection.

The message: DUNE.X does not sell individual garments. It engineers a departure kit. You buy into a system that begins with your body and ends with a complete architecture for transit.
