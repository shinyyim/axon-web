# DUNE.X — Commercial Film Storyboard

**Title:** *"DEPARTURE"*
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**Format:** 2.39:1 Cinemascope
**Sound Design:** Dark ambient → mechanical rhythm → silence → single tone

---

## Narrative Arc

The film follows the journey of material — from raw particles on another world, through computational manufacturing, into a designed space, and finally onto a human body. It is a creation story: the birth of a garment from the ground of an uninhabited planet.

**Emotional arc:** Mystery → Wonder → Awe → Intimacy → Clarity

## Scene 01: ORIGIN
**Timecode:** 0:00 – 0:06

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Extreme macro. Mineral dust particles suspended in pure darkness, slowly coalescing into a fabric-like formation. Each particle is individually lit with warm amber micro-highlights. |
| **Camera** | Locked off, then imperceptible slow dolly in. 100fps slow motion. |
| **Movement** | Particles drift and connect. The structure emerges from chaos into order. |
| **Sound** | Deep subsonic rumble. Granular texture — individual grains of sound, like sand on metal. |
| **Mood** | Genesis. The beginning of something from nothing. |
| **Color** | Pure black with amber/gold particle highlights |

## Scene 02: FORM
**Timecode:** 0:06 – 0:12

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A garment materializing inside a manufacturing cell. The lower half is fully formed in bone-white membrane material; the upper half is mid-construction — visible computational lattice being deposited by robotic arms under a focused spotlight. |
| **Camera** | Slow arc from 3/4 front to profile. Rack focus from robotic arm to garment. 60fps. |
| **Movement** | Methodical, precise deposits of material. The lattice structure grows before our eyes. |
| **Sound** | Rising tension. Mechanical rhythm — precise, repeating, like a heartbeat of a machine. Tiny placement sounds. |
| **Mood** | Computation as craft. Technology with poetry. |
| **Color** | Cool industrial blue-white spotlight on bone-white garment, dark industrial surroundings |

## Scene 03: SPACE
**Timecode:** 0:12 – 0:18

![Flagship store interior with massive amber sculptural installation](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/storyboard/story_scene_03_1771526617759.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | The camera moves through a narrow concrete corridor (the "airlock") which suddenly opens into the vast cathedral-like flagship store. A massive amber sculptural form — raw, geological, like a Martian rock formation — hangs suspended in the center, casting warm volumetric light through dust particles. Products glow on pedestals around the perimeter. |
| **Camera** | Steadicam forward tracking shot through airlock, then gradual reveal of the space. 24fps. |
| **Movement** | Continuous forward motion. The space unfolds. Dust particles float through light beams. |
| **Sound** | Spatial resonance. The echo of the space itself — cathedral acoustics, the hum of the installation. |
| **Mood** | Sacred space. The store as temple. Arrival. |
| **Color** | Deep darkness with warm amber glow radiating from the central sculpture. Regolith tones. |

## Scene 04: BODY
**Timecode:** 0:18 – 0:24

![Model walking in profile wearing DUNE.X ensemble](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/storyboard/story_scene_04_1771526634882.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A figure walking in profile through a dark, minimal environment. Wearing the full DUNE.X ensemble: bone-white membrane coat with parametric panel lines, dark utility trousers, 3D-lattice boots. Dramatic rim lighting traces the edges of the garment. Shallow depth of field — the background dissolves into darkness. |
| **Camera** | Tracking alongside at walking speed. Profile shot. 72fps (slight slow motion). Camera at knee height, looking up. |
| **Movement** | Deliberate stride. The coat moves with the body — fabric catching light with each step. The boots grip the surface with visible engineered tread. |
| **Sound** | Human breath. Footsteps on hard surface — precise, rhythmic. Fabric movement sound. |
| **Mood** | The human element. The body activating the design. Purpose in motion. |
| **Color** | Desaturated. Bone-white garment catching warm rim light against dark void. |

## Scene 05: BRAND
**Timecode:** 0:24 – 0:30

![DUNE.X wordmark materializing from dust particles](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/storyboard/story_scene_05_1771526664816.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Pure black void. Dust particles from Scene 01 drift in from the edges, slowly assembling into letterforms. "DUNE.X" materializes in bone-white, wide-tracked geometric type. The particles are still slightly in motion at the letter edges — the brand was born from the material of another world. 2 seconds after the wordmark forms, "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." resolves below in monospaced type. |
| **Camera** | Locked off. Centered. No movement — stillness after all the motion. |
| **Movement** | Particles slow and stop. Final stillness. |
| **Sound** | All sound drops out. 1 second of complete silence. Then a single sustained tone — warm, analog, resolving. |
| **Mood** | Clarity. Brand statement. The meaning of everything that came before. |
| **Color** | Pure black and bone white. No warmth, no color — maximum contrast for the logo. |
| **Reference** | SpaceX mission end cards + luxury brand film end frames |

## Technical Notes

### Post-Production
- **Grade:** Overall desaturated with selective warm accents (regolith/amber tones)
- **Grain:** Subtle film grain throughout (35mm texture)
- **Transitions:** Cross-dissolves between scenes, 12-frame overlap. No cuts — everything flows.
- **Title cards:** None during the film. Logo only at the end.

### Aspect Ratio & Delivery
| Format | Ratio | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Master** | 2.39:1 | Cinema, website hero, YouTube |
| **Social** | 9:16 | Instagram Stories/Reels, TikTok |
| **Square** | 1:1 | Instagram feed, gallery |

### Production Approach
Scenes 01-02 and 05 can be achieved with **practical macro photography + VFX compositing**. Scenes 03-04 require **location/set build + styled talent**. The airlock corridor in Scene 03 could be a practical set or achieved via LED volume stage.
