# DUNE.X Flagship — Retail Plan

---

## Spatial Concept: The Vertical Airlock

The DUNE.X flagship is not a store. It is a vertical airlock — a seven-level decompression sequence that transitions the visitor from the street to the threshold of departure. Each floor is a pressure chamber. Each transition is a controlled equalization. By the time the elevator doors open on 5F, you have already left.

The building operates on a single principle: **ascent is narrative**. Ground level is Earth. The upper floors are somewhere else. The journey between them is not circulation — it is transformation. You enter as a pedestrian. You exit as a departure candidate.

Thirty meters of vertical architecture. Six floors above grade. One below. A single elevator shaft that skips a floor. A staircase that descends through darkness. The building is narrow, tall, compressed — a silo, a launch tube, a core sample pulled from the future and placed on a city street.

Total area: ~2,600 sqft.
Floor-to-floor: 5m (16.4 ft).
Construction: New build.

## Customer Journey — Floor by Floor

### B1 — The Arena (Below Grade)

**Elevation:** -5.0m to 0.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** Variable (event-dependent)

The basement is the origin. Beneath the street, beneath the threshold, beneath the journey — the event floor exists as a raw volume. Independent from the retail sequence. Accessed by a dedicated stair from 1F or by service elevator.

This is where DUNE.X speaks to many at once. Fashion shows. Product launches. Installations. Sound events. The space is deliberately unfinished — dark concrete walls, exposed ceiling structure, a flexible floor with embedded power and data grids. No fixed furniture. No permanent display. The room reconfigures.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Event Arena | 250 sqft | Open volume, 4.5m clear ceiling height. Blackout capable. Floor-embedded 1.2m x 1.2m grid of power/data access points. Modular staging possible. Designed for 40–60 standing, 25–30 seated configurations. |
| Backstage / Storage | 50 sqft | Enclosed service zone behind the arena. Equipment staging. Temporary wardrobe. Controlled access door to service corridor. |
| Service Access | 25 sqft | Loading corridor. Connects to building service entrance at grade (rear). Equipment lift access. |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Fire stair + service elevator landing. The stair continues up through all floors. |

#### Spatial Character

The ceiling is exposed structure — blackened steel beams at 4.5m, with a cable tray grid carrying power and signal. Walls are raw board-formed concrete, untreated. The floor is polished dark concrete with a shallow 50mm recess in the arena zone, allowing temporary installations to sit flush. A single linear light channel runs the full length of the ceiling — the only fixed illumination. Everything else is temporary: track lighting, projection, portable fixtures brought in per event.

The acoustic signature is low. Concrete surfaces create natural reverberation. For spoken events, temporary acoustic panels mount to wall-embedded anchor points. For sound installations, the reverb is the instrument.

**Configuration Examples:**
- **Fashion Show:** Linear runway along the long axis. 25 seats per side. Backstage staging behind a movable partition. Single spotlight track follows the runway.
- **Product Launch:** Central pedestal under a suspended light ring (1.8m diameter, lowered from ceiling winch points). Standing audience surrounds.
- **Installation:** Full room takeover. Projection mapping on all four walls. Floor cleared. Visitors enter and stand within the work.

### 1F — Arrival (Ground Level)

**Elevation:** 0.0m to +5.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** Medium — controlled restraint
**Product on display:** None

The first floor is a threshold. Its only purpose is to separate the street from the void. The visitor crosses a boundary — from the bright, noisy, horizontal city into a dark, silent, vertical interior. This transition must be felt in the body: the compression of the entry corridor, the pressure drop as the ceiling rises, the sudden absence of natural light.

No product is displayed here. No price tags. No merchandise. This floor sells nothing except the feeling of having arrived somewhere that is not a store.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Airlock Entry Corridor | 120 sqft | Compressed linear passage. 1.4m wide, 2.4m ceiling height (less than half the floor-to-floor). Walls close in. Dark plaster surfaces absorb light. Length: approximately 7m. The corridor narrows the visitor's field of vision and eliminates the street. At the end, the space opens. |
| Reception / Brand Chamber | 115 sqft | The corridor releases into a taller volume — ceiling opens to 4.2m. Single DUNE.X wordmark on the back wall, edge-lit from behind: white light bleeding around the letterforms. Below the wordmark, a single vitrine holds a sealed Terrain Boot 01 specimen — not for sale, not labeled, not explained. A threshold artifact. |
| Escalator Landing | 50 sqft | Escalator terminus from 4F. Visitors descending from checkout arrive here and walk directly to the exit. The landing is spatially separate from the entry corridor — descending visitors do not collide with arriving ones. |
| Street Entrance | 40 sqft | The facade threshold. A single recessed door — blackened steel frame, 2.8m height, narrow — set into a monolithic dark facade. No window display. No visible merchandise from the street. The door is the only opening. Above it, a single line of text in Söhne Mono, 14pt equivalent: `DUNE.X` |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Elevator + stair access. From 1F, the staircase leads both down to B1 and up to 2F. |

#### The Airlock Sequence (Detailed)

The entry corridor is the most deliberately choreographed 7 meters in the building. The visitor pushes through a heavy pivot door (blackened steel, counterweighted, slow-closing). The door seals behind them. Street noise drops. The corridor is narrow — 1.4m, one person wide. The walls are dark mineral plaster, slightly textured, absorbing what little light exists. The ceiling is low: 2.4m.

Underfoot: a floor material change. The sidewalk's concrete gives way to a dark resin surface, seamless and reflective. The visitor's footsteps change sound. At ankle height, a continuous linear LED strip — 2700K, very dim — provides the only directional light, pulling the eye forward.

Midway through the corridor: a gentle 15-degree bend. The street entrance disappears from view. You can no longer see where you came from.

The corridor ends. The ceiling rises from 2.4m to 4.2m in a single step. The walls fall away. You are standing in the reception chamber. Ahead: the DUNE.X wordmark, backlit, hovering. Below it: a single object in a sealed case. Above: darkness.

This is not a greeting. It is an equalization.

#### Wayfinding

No conventional signage on this floor. No "Welcome" text. No floor directories. The architecture directs: the corridor has one direction; the staircase has one direction (up). The escalator landing is visually separated — arriving and departing visitors use different spatial paths.

---

### 2F — Experience Zone

**Elevation:** +5.0m to +10.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** High — immersive brand world
**Product on display:** None (data and process only)

The second floor is where the visitor learns what DUNE.X is — not through signage or copy, but through direct sensory encounter. This is the biodata floor. The space where the body's own signals become visible.

The biodata scan is optional. Visitors may pass through 2F without participating. Those who do participate step into a scanning chamber. Those who do not experience the AI visualization wall and interactive installation as passive observers. Both paths lead to the same staircase to 3F.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Biodata Scanning Station | 100 sqft | An enclosed scanning alcove — 2.0m x 3.0m interior, 3.0m ceiling height. Walls are dark, matte-finished composite panels. The visitor stands on a force-sensing floor plate (600mm x 600mm). Overhead: a ring of 12 depth-sensing cameras mounted flush into the ceiling, arranged in a 1.5m diameter circle. The ring glows faintly — Portal White, 10% intensity — during standby. When scanning begins, the ring brightens to full. Duration: 45 seconds. The visitor stands, shifts weight, takes three steps forward and back. The system captures gait, weight distribution, foot strike pattern, posture axis, and limb proportions. |
| AI Visualization Wall | 80 sqft | A 4.0m-wide, 2.5m-tall display surface covering the primary wall. Not a screen — a rear-projection surface embedded in dark plaster. Shows real-time generative visualizations: biodata translated into parametric form. Movement trajectories rendered as luminous filaments on black. Force maps as topographic gradients. If a visitor has just been scanned, their data appears. If not, the wall cycles through anonymized datasets — always moving, always generating. |
| Interactive Installation | 100 sqft | A freestanding installation occupying the center of the floor. Currently configured for launch: a 1.2m-diameter transparent acrylic cylinder, floor-to-ceiling, containing a single Terrain Boot 01 suspended at eye level. Around the cylinder, holographic data projections orbit — parametric wireframes, material spec readouts, biodata-derived sole geometry. Visitors walk around it. The projections respond to proximity — closer approach reveals deeper data layers. |
| Transition Corridor | 45 sqft | Passage to the staircase leading to 3F. A narrowing corridor — the space compresses again before opening on the next floor. |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Stair + elevator. Stair continues from 1F. |

#### Spatial Character

The dominant material is darkness. The ceiling is not visible — it disappears above 3.5m into blackout conditions (matte black acoustic ceiling panels). The floor is the same dark resin as 1F, maintaining continuity. The scanning station is the brightest element: the overhead ring and the floor plate are the only concentrated light sources. Everything else — the visualization wall, the holographic projections — is luminous data against void.

Sound on this floor: a low-frequency ambient drone, barely perceptible. 40–60 Hz. It sits below conscious hearing but registers in the body. The scanning station adds its own audio: a rising tone during capture, a resolve tone at completion.

---

### 3F — Cafe & Gathering

**Elevation:** +10.0m to +15.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** Medium-Low — deliberate warmth
**Product on display:** None

The third floor is the last human floor. After this, the journey becomes mechanical and otherworldly. 3F exists as a decompression pause — a social space, a cafe, a place to sit. The warmth here is intentional. This is the only floor where Signal Red appears as an environmental element, not just an accent.

The elevator lobby on this floor is the departure gate. The visitor takes the elevator from 3F to 5F. The fourth floor is skipped. This is the last moment before the reveal.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Lounge Seating | 140 sqft | Low seating arranged in two clusters. Custom benches — sand-cast aluminum frames, dark leather cushions. Seating height: 380mm (lower than standard, grounded). Between the clusters: a low table in blackened steel, 800mm x 400mm x 300mm. The seating faces inward, creating a contained social zone. Above the seating: a suspended light ring — 2.0m diameter, Portal White, dimmed to 30%. The first ceiling element the visitor has seen since entering the building. |
| Cafe Counter + Prep | 80 sqft | A minimal counter in polished dark concrete, 900mm height, 2.4m length. Behind the counter: a matte black service wall with recessed equipment — espresso machine, water dispensing, minimal refrigeration. Menu is not posted. Three items available, presented on a single card (Söhne Mono, 11pt): one espresso preparation, one cold brew, one non-coffee option. Cups are custom — matte black ceramic, debossed D.X mark on the base. |
| Elevator Lobby | 60 sqft | The departure gate. A recessed alcove on the far wall, opposite the cafe counter. The elevator door is matte blackened steel, flush with the wall. No call button is visible. Instead: a single horizontal line of light at waist height — 1.2m wide, 3mm thick — glows steadily. As the elevator arrives, the line brightens and the door opens. Above the door, a single line of text, laser-etched into the wall: `THRESHOLD` in Söhne Mono. |
| Restroom | 45 sqft | Single-occupancy. Dark mineral plaster walls. Continuous integrated sink — a single trough of polished black stone. Lighting: a vertical slot in the wall, 50mm wide, full height, emitting warm white light (3000K — the warmest light in the building). |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Stair + elevator. The staircase continues upward but is marked with a subtle but clear spatial signal — the stair width narrows slightly above 3F, discouraging casual ascent. The elevator is the intended path. |

#### The Elevator Lobby — Departure Choreography

The visitor has had a coffee. They have sat in a space that, for the first time in the building, felt almost comfortable. Now they approach the elevator.

The horizontal line of light pulses once. The doors part. The elevator interior is small — 1.2m x 1.0m, capacity two. The walls are matte black. The ceiling: a single recessed panel emitting cold white light, evenly distributed. No floor buttons are visible. The elevator knows its route: 3F to 5F. The visitor steps in. The doors close.

A 12-second ascent. The light in the ceiling dims to near-darkness during the ride. Silence. Then, gradually, a low ambient tone — not heard so much as felt — rises in frequency. The elevator slows. The light returns, colder now. The doors open.

The visitor is no longer on Earth.

---

### 4F — Checkout (Skipped on Ascent, Visited on Descent)

**Elevation:** +15.0m to +20.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** Minimal — functional, clinical, deliberate
**Product on display:** None (packaging as product moment)

The fourth floor is never visited on the way up. The elevator bypasses it entirely — 3F to 5F, no stop. The staircase passes through 4F but is spatially constricted: the stair landing on this floor is enclosed, offering no visual connection to the checkout space. You would have to deliberately open a door and enter.

On descent, after 6F manufacturing and the emotional peak of 5F, the visitor arrives at 4F for checkout and packaging. The contrast is intentional. After the theater of 5F and 6F, 4F is quiet. Clean. Efficient. A return to operational reality.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout Counter | 80 sqft | A single monolithic counter — polished dark concrete, 1.0m height, 2.0m length. Embedded flush into the surface: a single tablet-scale display for transaction. No cash register. No POS terminal on the counter. Payment is digital — tap, scan, or biometric (linked to 2F scan if opted in). One staff member. |
| Packaging Station | 70 sqft | Behind the checkout counter, visible to the customer through a low transparent partition. Branded packaging is assembled here: matte black boxes, tissue paper in Bone (#E8E0D4), a sealed envelope containing the garment's biodata certificate — a printed data sheet showing the biometric inputs that shaped the piece. The packaging ritual takes 3–4 minutes. The visitor watches. |
| Pickup Waiting | 80 sqft | A minimal seating area — two benches, same sand-cast aluminum as 3F, shorter. A small display monitor mounted flush in the wall shows the status of the visitor's garment: fabrication complete, packaging in progress, ready. Updates arrive from 6F in real time. |
| Escalator to 1F | 50 sqft | A single-run escalator descending from 4F to 1F (three floors, approximately 15m vertical travel). The escalator is enclosed in a narrow shaft — dark walls, no external views. The descent is quiet. At the bottom: the escalator landing on 1F, near the exit. |
| Staff Support | 45 sqft | Back-of-house area. Staff break space, storage for packaging materials, communication system linked to 6F manufacturing. |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Stair + elevator. The elevator serves this floor on the descent cycle only. |

#### The 4F Skip — Spatial Reinforcement

The elevator does not stop at 4F on ascent. But the building must also spatially communicate this skip. Three design decisions reinforce the bypass:

1. **Stair constriction:** The staircase at the 4F landing narrows to 800mm and passes through a closed fire door. No view into 4F from the stair. No invitation to explore.
2. **No wayfinding reference:** On floors 1F–3F, there is no mention of the fourth floor. The elevator lobby on 3F refers only to the "threshold." The journey narrative jumps from three to five.
3. **Material discontinuity:** 4F is the only floor with standard gypsum wall finish (painted matte black) instead of the mineral plaster or concrete used elsewhere. The material itself signals: this floor is functional infrastructure, not narrative space.

---

### 5F — The Reveal

**Elevation:** +20.0m to +25.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** Maximum — total scenery change
**Product on display:** 4–5 hero pieces (Terrain Boot 01 as centerpiece)

This is the building's reason for existing. The emotional peak. The moment the elevator doors open and the visitor discovers they are no longer in a building — they are on the surface of another world.

The entire floor is a constructed planetary environment. The floor surface changes. The ceiling disappears. The light changes. The temperature drops 2–3 degrees (active HVAC cooling). The ambient sound shifts from the low drone of the lower floors to something vast and empty — a recording of near-silence, wind over regolith, the sound of atmospheric absence.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Planetary Environment | 200 sqft | The main volume. Floor: a 50mm layer of dark mineral aggregate — crushed basalt, matte black — covering the structural slab. Uneven, textured, crunching underfoot. The visitor steps off the elevator onto another surface entirely. Walls: floor-to-ceiling rear-projection panels displaying a 270-degree surround — not a literal planet surface, but an abstraction: dark terrain, a low horizon line, stars above. The image is nearly still — no animation, no motion. A landscape at rest. The ceiling is open black void above 4.0m, with a single suspended light element: a 3.0m-diameter ring of white LED, glowing at full intensity. The portal. It hovers above the product zone, casting a circle of cold light onto the display below. |
| Product Display Vitrines | 80 sqft | Positioned directly beneath the light ring. Four to five display pedestals — each a 400mm x 400mm x 900mm column of matte black steel. On each pedestal: a single product under a glass dome (300mm diameter, 400mm height). Edge-lit from below. The Terrain Boot 01 occupies the center pedestal, slightly elevated (1000mm). The other pieces are supporting collection items: Transit Shell 01, a membrane glove, a data-woven base layer. Each vitrine has a small data panel at its base — a 150mm x 80mm OLED screen showing the product's biodata lineage in real time. |
| Elevator Arrival Zone | 45 sqft | The first 1.5m in front of the elevator doors. This is what the visitor sees when the doors open. Designed as a liminal strip: the elevator's polished black floor ends, and the crushed basalt begins. Ahead: the planetary landscape and the hovering light ring. The transition from machine interior to constructed exterior happens in a single step. |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Stair to 6F. The staircase from 5F to 6F is open — no enclosure. The visitor sees the stair and ascends willingly. The stair treads are blackened steel, open-riser, each step edge-lit with a thin white LED line. |

#### The Elevator Reveal — Second by Second

**T+0.0s:** Elevator doors begin to open. A sliver of cold light enters. The ambient sound shifts — the low drone gives way to spatial emptiness.

**T+1.0s:** Doors fully open. The visitor sees: a dark, textured ground surface stretching away. Beyond it, a dim horizon. Above, a massive ring of white light suspended in void. Beneath the ring, objects on pedestals, glowing faintly.

**T+2.0s:** The temperature difference registers. Cooler. The air is drier (humidity controlled to 35% on this floor, vs. 45% below).

**T+3.0s:** The visitor steps forward. The basalt crunches underfoot. The sound confirms: you are somewhere else.

**T+5.0s onward:** Exploration. The visitor moves toward the light ring and the vitrines. Each step changes the surround projection subtly — the horizon shifts with parallax, very slowly. The landscape is not static. It is barely alive.

---

### 6F — Manufacturing

**Elevation:** +25.0m to +30.0m
**Area:** 370 sqft
**Conceptual Intensity:** High — operational theater
**Product on display:** The product being made

The top floor is the forge. If 5F is the destination — the world the garment was made for — then 6F is the origin: the place where the garment comes into being. Real robotic fabrication. Real materials. Real production.

This is not theatrical. The manufacturing equipment is functional. A robotic arm assembles 3D-printed sole components. A precision cutting system shapes membrane panels. An automated stitching station joins layered composites. The visitor watches their garment being made — or, if they have not purchased, they watch a demonstration cycle producing specimen pieces.

#### Zone Definitions

| Zone | Area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Robotic Fabrication Theater | 150 sqft | The main production zone, enclosed behind a floor-to-ceiling glass partition (12mm laminated safety glass, anti-reflective coating). Inside: a KUKA KR6 R900 robotic arm (or equivalent 6-axis unit) on a 1.5m x 1.5m steel base plate, surrounded by a material feed system — spools of composite filament, membrane sheet stock, sole blanks on a rotary magazine. The robot performs assembly tasks: sole printing, membrane trimming, component bonding. Cycle time for a complete Terrain Boot 01: approximately 22 minutes. Overhead: a linear array of cold white LEDs (5000K) illuminating the work zone — the brightest light in the building. The machine is the specimen here. |
| Viewing Gallery | 75 sqft | A narrow observation corridor running along the glass partition. Standing room — no seating. The glass is angled 3 degrees off vertical, leaning slightly toward the visitor, eliminating reflections and creating a sensation of proximity. The floor on the visitor side is raised 200mm on a steel platform, aligning eye level with the robotic arm's working height. Along the gallery rail: a continuous data display strip — a 50mm-tall LED ticker running the full 3.5m length. It shows real-time fabrication telemetry: material temperature, force applied, layer count, completion percentage. |
| Handoff Counter | 60 sqft | At the end of the viewing gallery, a counter where the finished garment is presented. The product emerges from the fabrication zone through a small pass-through hatch (300mm x 300mm, pneumatic door). It arrives in a sealed transparent case. A staff member opens the case, inspects the piece, and presents it to the visitor. This is the only moment in the building where a human hand touches the product in front of the customer. |
| Back of House | 40 sqft | Equipment maintenance access, raw material storage, climate control for the fabrication zone (temperature and humidity held constant for material consistency). Accessed through a service door from the viewing gallery, staff only. |
| Vertical Core | 45 sqft | Stair down to 5F and 4F. The descent begins here. The stair from 6F passes through 5F (visible but the visitor has already experienced it) and continues down to 4F for checkout. |

---

## Descent Sequence: 6F to 4F to 1F

The descent is the journey's resolution. After the emotional peak of 5F and the operational theater of 6F, the visitor carries their newly fabricated piece and descends.

**6F → 5F (Staircase):** The open-riser blackened steel stair. Passing back through the planetary environment. The visitor sees it from above now — a different perspective. The light ring seen from the side. The vitrines below. A last glance at the world before re-entering the building.

**5F → 4F (Staircase):** The stair encloses. Walls close in. The planetary environment disappears behind a closing door. The material shifts — from crushed basalt and projection surfaces to matte black gypsum. You are back inside.

**4F — Checkout:** The visitor presents their piece (or its fabrication confirmation) at the checkout counter. Payment. Packaging. The biodata certificate is sealed into the box. Duration: 5–8 minutes.

**4F → 1F (Escalator):** A long, enclosed, single-run escalator descending three floors. The shaft is narrow — 1.0m wide between dark walls. The descent takes approximately 90 seconds. No views out. The visitor re-enters their own thoughts. At the bottom: the 1F escalator landing, the exit door, the street.

**Exit:** The same heavy pivot door. It opens outward. Daylight. Noise. The city.

---

## Product Display Strategy

### Zero Product on 1F–3F

The first three floors display no merchandise. This is deliberate. The visitor must experience the brand world — the void, the biodata, the social space — before encountering anything for sale. The building earns the right to sell by first earning attention.

The only pre-5F product presence: the sealed Terrain Boot 01 specimen in the 1F reception chamber (not for sale, not labeled) and the holographic data projection around the 2F interactive installation.

### 4–5 Hero Pieces on 5F

The reveal floor displays a curated selection — never more than five pieces. For launch:

| Position | Piece | Display |
|---|---|---|
| Center (elevated) | Terrain Boot 01 | Glass dome, edge-lit from below, 1000mm pedestal |
| Left of center | Transit Shell 01 | Glass dome, suspended on monofilament at chest height |
| Right of center | Membrane Glove 01 | Glass dome, resting on formed hand mold |
| Far left | Data-Woven Base Layer | Glass dome, draped over minimal torso form |
| Far right | Mission Kit (complete set) | Larger vitrine, 600mm x 400mm, showing all components |

Every piece is displayed as a specimen under examination. Not on racks. Not folded. Not hung. Isolated. Edge-lit. Treated as an artifact recovered from the future.

### 6F — The Product Being Born

On 6F, the product on display is the one being manufactured. The visitor watches it come into existence. This is the most powerful product display in the building — not a finished object in a case, but a process in motion. The garment earns its value in real time.

---

## Wayfinding Strategy: Light as Direction

DUNE.X uses no conventional signage. No floor directories. No arrows. No "You Are Here" maps. The building's wayfinding system is light itself.

### Principles

1. **Light leads.** Every transition — door, stair, elevator — is marked by a specific light element. The visitor follows the light.
2. **Text is rare and technical.** Where text appears, it is laser-etched or debossed into surfaces — never applied, never mounted. Font: Söhne Mono. Color: Bone (#E8E0D4) or Portal White. Words used: `THRESHOLD`, `DEPARTURE`, `ORIGIN`, `D.X`.
3. **The floor has a voice.** Floor-level LED strips (ankle height, 2700K) provide directional guidance in dark corridors. They pulse once toward the next destination, then hold steady.
4. **Elevation is communicated by light temperature.** Lower floors use warmer light (2700–3000K). Upper floors use cooler light (4000–5000K). The visitor's body registers the shift before their mind names it.

### Wayfinding Elements per Floor

| Floor | Wayfinding Element | Description |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Floor-embedded grid | Power/data access points double as orientation markers. A single brighter node marks the exit stair. |
| 1F | Ankle-level LED corridor strip | 2700K, pulls the visitor through the airlock. The only directional light in the entry. |
| 2F | Scanning ring glow | The biodata ring is the floor's brightest element — it draws the visitor toward the experience. Exit corridor marked by a second, dimmer strip. |
| 3F | Suspended light ring (above seating) + elevator line | The warm ring centers the social space. The horizontal light line at the elevator door signals departure. |
| 4F | Escalator down-light | A continuous light strip along the escalator descent marks the exit path. No warm light on this floor — all cool white, functional. |
| 5F | The portal ring | The 3.0m suspended LED ring is the floor's primary wayfinding element. Everything radiates from it. The open stair to 6F has edge-lit treads — ascend. |
| 6F | Fabrication zone illumination | The brightest zone in the building (5000K overhead LEDs) draws the visitor forward. The handoff counter is marked by a single warm downlight — the only warm element on the upper floors. |

---

## Acoustic Strategy

The building has no background music. No playlist. No ambient soundscape piped through speakers. Instead, each floor has its own acoustic identity — shaped by material, mechanical systems, and intentional audio design.

| Floor | Acoustic Character |
|---|---|
| B1 | Reverberant. Concrete surfaces create 2.0–2.5s RT60. Event-dependent treatment. |
| 1F | Compressed. The narrow corridor creates proximity. Footstep sound changes at the resin threshold. |
| 2F | Sub-bass drone (40–60 Hz). Scanning tones during biodata capture. Low reverb — acoustic ceiling panels absorb above 3.5m. |
| 3F | The quietest floor. Soft absorption from seating materials. Cafe sounds — ceramic, liquid, low conversation. |
| 4F | Functional silence. Minimal absorption. Transaction sounds. Packaging materials. |
| 5F | Vast emptiness. The surround projection emits a low atmospheric tone — near-silence with micro-texture. Crushed basalt underfoot provides tactile audio feedback. |
| 6F | Machine frequency. The robotic arm's servo motors, material feed mechanisms, and pneumatic systems create the floor's sound. Rhythmic. Precise. Industrial but controlled. |

## Accessibility Notes

- Elevator serves all floors (B1 through 6F). Wheelchair accessible throughout.
- The 1F airlock corridor width (1.4m) exceeds minimum accessible passage requirements.
- 5F floor surface (crushed basalt) includes a smooth-paved accessible path from elevator to vitrines — a 900mm-wide strip of polished dark resin through the aggregate field.
- Restroom on 3F is accessible (single-occupancy, adequate turning radius).
- Escalator descent from 4F to 1F is supplemented by elevator access for those who need it.

---

## Operating Model

- **Hours:** 11:00–20:00, 7 days.
- **Staff per shift:** 4–5 (1F host, 2F guide, 3F barista, 5F–6F product specialist, 4F checkout).
- **Fabrication schedule:** Terrain Boot 01 production runs on demand during operating hours. Demonstration cycles run continuously when no customer order is active.
- **Event programming (B1):** 2–4 events per month. Scheduled outside retail hours or by invitation during.
- **Capacity:** Maximum 15–20 visitors in the building at any time. Entry is not ticketed but may be managed by the 1F host during peak periods.

*"The building is a single breath held between the street and the sky. Enter at ground. Arrive at departure."*
