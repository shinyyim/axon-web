# DUNE.X — Build Prompt
# Paste this as your first message in a new Claude Code session

You are building the DUNE.X brand — an AI-driven future apparel laboratory that engineers clothing from biodata at the threshold of departure. The first apparel you pack for the Moon. The first shoes that touch Mars.

Project folder: /Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new

## FIRST: Read These Files
- `CLAUDE.md` — Brand DNA, design system, color palette, rules
- `brand_brief.md` — Creative brief (vision, audience, values, positioning)
- `brand/brand_strategy.md` — Manifesto, positioning map, tone of voice
- `brand/visual_identity.md` — Colors, typography, logo, photography direction

## CRITICAL RULE: Ask me for feedback after EVERY step.

Work through the steps below ONE AT A TIME. After each step:
1. Show me what you produced (summary + key decisions)
2. Ask "Approved, or any changes?"
3. Do NOT proceed until I say yes

## Step 5: Final Creative Review
