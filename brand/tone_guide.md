# DUNE.X — Tone of Voice Guide

---

## Purpose

This document governs how DUNE.X speaks across every touchpoint. All teams — Film, Spatial, Web, Product, UX — must follow these rules without exception. The voice is the brand. Break the voice, break the world.

---

## Voice Character: Clinical Poet

DUNE.X speaks like a mission controller who reads poetry after hours. Precise. Measured. Aware of the weight of what is about to happen. Never excited. Never selling. Stating what is, with the quiet authority of someone who has already seen the departure.

### Parameters

| Dimension | Direction | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| **Register** | Formal but not cold. Technical but not sterile. | 70% precision, 30% awe |
| **Emotion** | Restrained. Never absent, but never overt. The reader feels it in the structure, not the adjectives. | Emotion is in the rhythm, not the vocabulary |
| **Technical precision** | Exact measurements, material names, process terms. Specification is poetry. | Always specific: "3.2mm" not "thin", "4-layer" not "multi-layer" |
| **Sentence length** | Short. Fragments are allowed and encouraged. Maximum 18 words per sentence. | Average sentence: 6-10 words |
| **Paragraph length** | 1-3 sentences maximum. White space is structural. | Every paragraph earns its space |
| **Punctuation** | The period is a design element. No exclamation marks. Ever. | See Punctuation Rules below |

### The Voice Sounds Like

- A mission brief written at 0300
- A materials scientist describing something they find quietly beautiful
- Technical documentation that happens to be moving
- A monolith speaking

### The Voice Does NOT Sound Like

- A press release
- A copywriter
- A lifestyle brand Instagram caption
- A startup pitch deck
- A sports brand "just do it" motivational call

## AI and Biodata Copy Rules

This section is critical. Every team that writes about DUNE.X's biodata intelligence must follow these rules exactly. The technology is real, but how we describe it defines the brand.

### Core Principle

Biodata is a **material**, not a technology. Treat it the way a craftsperson treats wood grain or metal temper. The body provides data. The data becomes structure. That is all.

Never explain how the AI works. Never use the language of Silicon Valley. Never make it sound like an app feature. The intelligence is embedded, not advertised.

### Do / Don't Table

| DO write | DON'T write |
|---|---|
| "Computed from your cadence." | "Our AI analyzes your biometric data in real-time." |
| "Engineered from your movement." | "Personalized to your unique walking pattern." |
| "Your gait shaped the lattice." | "Our algorithm creates a customized sole based on your gait analysis." |
| "The scan becomes structure." | "We use advanced body scanning technology." |
| "Singular to you." | "Personalized just for you." |
| "Derived from pressure data." | "Our sensors capture real-time pressure distribution." |
| "The body is the template." | "Using cutting-edge biometric sensors." |
| "Computed for one body." | "AI-powered customization." |
| "Data as material." | "Data-driven design." |
| "Biodata-reactive membrane." | "Smart fabric that responds to your body." |
| "Cadence-mapped sole geometry." | "A sole that adapts to your walking style." |
| "The signal shapes the form." | "Our technology reads your biometric signals to create..." |

### Biodata Language Rules

1. **"Biodata" is a DUNE.X material word.** Use it the way you would say "carbon composite" or "sealed membrane." It is what the garment is made from, not a technology feature.
2. **Never say "algorithm."** The word is banned. Say: "computation", "process", "the system", or nothing at all. The best biodata copy never names the mechanism.
3. **Never say "real-time."** The phrase belongs to dashboards and stock tickers. If you must convey immediacy: "The scan captures. The structure follows."
4. **Never say "personalized" or "customized."** These are e-commerce words. Say: "singular", "computed for you", "engineered from your data", "shaped by your cadence."
5. **Never say "smart" (smart fabric, smart shoe, smart garment).** The word implies novelty. DUNE.X garments are not smart. They are engineered.
6. **The body is always the subject, never the technology.** Write: "Your body generates the pattern." Not: "Our AI generates the pattern from your body."
7. **Process descriptions use passive-material voice.** "The sole is grown from pressure data" not "We grow the sole using pressure data."
8. **Keep biodata copy to one sentence when possible.** The power is in restraint. "Computed from your cadence." is a complete product feature description.

## Copy Rules by Team

### Film Team

- No dialogue. Ever. Voices do not speak in DUNE.X films.
- No narration that explains. Voiceover, if used, is Clinical Poet fragments — isolated sentences that feel like text cards, not storytelling.
- On-screen text uses Söhne Mono. Short. Technical. Appears and holds.
- Text examples: "TERRAIN BOOT 01." / "Computed from cadence." / "DEPARTURE 001."
- Sound carries the emotion. Music and foley replace words.
- If text appears over footage, it fades in from void (800ms), holds (2000ms minimum), fades to void (600ms).

### Spatial Team

- All signage uses **Söhne Mono**, not Monument Extended. The store is a research facility, not a billboard.
- Wayfinding text is lowercase Söhne Mono: "level 02 — experience zone", "scanning in progress", "manufacturing — active".
- Product labels in-store follow tech-readout format:
  ```
  TERRAIN BOOT 01
  Colorway: Void
  Frame: Custom / DX-TB01-4729
  Biodata: Gait analysis, pressure mapping
  ```
- No marketing language on any surface in the store. No taglines on walls. The space speaks through light and material, not words.
- Exception: "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." appears once, in the arrival corridor (1F), in Monument Extended, as threshold text. Nowhere else.
- Environmental text (data readouts on screens, ambient displays) uses Söhne Mono Light at 10-12px equivalent. Content is live biodata visualizations, not marketing copy.

### Product Team

- Specification first, poetry second.
- Product descriptions follow this structure:
  1. Product name (Monument Extended, ALL CAPS)
  2. One-line material/construction statement
  3. Technical specifications (numbered or listed)
  4. Biodata integration statement (one sentence, passive voice)
  5. Colorway options
- No marketing adjectives. None. Not "lightweight" — state the gram weight. Not "breathable" — state the moisture vapor transmission rate. Not "comfortable" — describe the construction that produces comfort.
- Example:
  ```
  TERRAIN BOOT 01
  Computational lattice sole with sealed membrane upper.
  — Sole: PA12 nylon lattice, biodata-generated geometry
  — Upper: 4-layer bonded membrane, 0.8mm total stack
  — Closure: Magnetic seal with manual override
  — Mass: 312g (Frame 04 equivalent)
  Sole geometry computed from individual gait pressure map.
  Colorway: Void / Bone
  ```

### UX Team (Web + Digital Interfaces)

- Microcopy is Clinical Poet. Every button, every label, every error state.
- Do / Don't:

| Context | DO write | DON'T write |
|---|---|---|
| CTA button | "Begin scan" | "Start your personalized experience" |
| CTA button | "Reserve appointment" | "Book now" |
| CTA button | "View system" | "Explore our collection" |
| Loading state | "Computing." | "Please wait while we process..." |
| Empty state | "No data yet." | "You haven't added anything yet." |
| Error | "Scan incomplete. Repeat." | "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again." |
| Confirmation | "Appointment confirmed. 2F." | "You're all set! We'll see you there." |
| Product CTA | "Examine" | "Learn more" |
| Cart/order | "Transit manifest" | "Shopping cart" |
| Checkout | "Confirm departure" | "Complete your order" |
| Size selection | "Select Frame" | "Choose your size" |

- No feature carousels. Information does not rotate.
- No testimonials. DUNE.X does not ask for endorsement.
- No newsletter popups. If email capture exists, it is a single line at footer: "Receive transmissions." with a monoline input field.
- No chatbots. No "How can I help you?" overlays.
- No countdown timers, no urgency language ("Only 3 left"), no social proof ("1,247 people are viewing this").
- Form labels use Söhne Mono, sentence case, no colons.

### Web Team

- Hero sections: One headline (Monument Extended, ALL CAPS), maximum 4 words. One subtitle, maximum 12 words (Neue Montreal).
- No feature carousels, no testimonials, no newsletter popups (same rules as UX).
- Section transitions: content emerges from void. No slide-ins from sides. No bounce effects.
- Product cards show: name, one-line description, price range. Nothing else. No ratings, no "bestseller" badges, no "new" tags.
- Footer is minimal: brand name, contact, legal. No social media icon rows. If social links exist, they are text links in Söhne Mono.
- Navigation uses Monument Extended, ALL CAPS, wide-tracked. Maximum 5 items.
- Page titles follow format: "DUNE.X — [PAGE NAME]" (with period, with dash).

## Punctuation Rules

### The Period

The period is a DUNE.X design element. It creates the mechanical pause that defines the brand rhythm.

- **DUNE.X** — The period between DUNE and X is the brand's typographic signature. It is always present. It is not optional.
- **Product names end with a period when used as headlines.** "TERRAIN BOOT 01." — the period signals completeness.
- **Campaign codenames end with a period.** "DEPARTURE." / "THRESHOLD." / "TRANSIT."
- **Tagline ends with a period.** "Future your Performance."
- **Short-form copy uses periods for rhythm.** "The body departs first." / "Computed from cadence." / "Scan. Compute. Manufacture."

### No Exclamation Marks

Never. Under no circumstances. Not in social media. Not in event invitations. Not in internal communications. The brand does not exclaim. It states.

### Colons and Dashes

- **Colons** are used in spec-sheet format: "Colorway: Void" / "Mass: 312g"
- **Em dashes (—)** are used for expansions and parenthetical precision: "The first apparel you pack for the Moon — engineered, not imagined."
- **En dashes (–)** are used for ranges: "$480–620" / "Frame 01–08"

### Ellipsis

Rarely. Only in campaign copy where the omission is intentional. "Not yet..." is acceptable. "Coming soon..." is not — it belongs to product launches, not thresholds.

### Quotation Marks

Minimal use. DUNE.X does not need to quote itself. If quoting brand vocabulary in instructional contexts, use bold formatting, not quotation marks.

### Capitalization

- **ALL CAPS** for: brand name, product names, collection names, campaign codenames, navigation labels, headline text in Monument Extended
- **Sentence case** for: body copy, technical specifications in Söhne Mono, spatial signage, UX microcopy
- **Never title case.** "Terrain Boot 01" is only acceptable in running body text. In all designed applications, it is "TERRAIN BOOT 01"

## Enforcement

Every piece of copy — whether it appears on a webpage, a garment label, a social post, a floor decal, or a loading screen — must pass this test:

*"Would this feel right at the threshold?"*

If the language sounds like it could come from any other brand, revise. If it explains too much, cut. If it sells too hard, strip it back. If it uses a forbidden word, replace it.

The voice is the architecture. Build accordingly.
