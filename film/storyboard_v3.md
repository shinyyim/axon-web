## Narrative Arc

This is not a brand film. This is a departure sequence.

The camera follows a single visitor from the street through every floor of the DUNE.X flagship — the airlock, the biodata scan, the cafe pause, the 42-second elevator transit, the planetary reveal, the fabrication theater, the handoff, and the exit. Every transition is earned. Every threshold is crossed. The building is the protagonist. The visitor is the subject.

The film mirrors the actual customer journey documented in `ux/journey_map.md` and `ux/spatial_ux.md`. What the visitor experiences in 60 minutes, the film compresses into 45 seconds. The feeling must survive the compression.

**Emotional arc:** Threshold → Intimacy → Suspension → Transit → Awe → Witness → Receipt → Release

**The brand's core chain runs beneath every scene:**
> The body generates data → Data reveals patterns → Patterns shape form → Form defines motion

## Scene 01: BLACK
**Timecode:** 0:00 – 0:02

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | Pure black. No image. Nothing. |
| **Camera** | — |
| **Sound** | True silence. Not ambient silence — digital silence. Zero signal. |
| **Voice-Over** | — |
| **Duration** | 2.0s |

## Scene 02: AIRLOCK
**Timecode:** 0:02 – 0:08

![Compression corridor with floor light line](/Users/shinyim/Documents/2026/Sci-arc/SP.2026/02.Brand_shoe_new/film/storyboard_visitor/02_entrance.png)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | A narrow corridor. 1.2 meters wide, 10 meters long, ceiling compressed to 2.4 meters. Walls are raw concrete — no finish, no decoration. A single thin line of Portal White light (8mm) runs along the floor, pulsing forward at walking pace. Sound dampens with each step. The street behind the visitor dissolves into darkness. At the corridor's end: the space opens. The ceiling rises to 5 meters. The DUNE.X wordmark is projected in Portal White on the far wall — monumental, faint — then dims and disappears. A host stands at the expansion point, dressed in DUNE.X. |
| **Camera** | Steadicam behind the visitor, tight. Walls closing on either side. The corridor compresses the frame. Then: the wide shot opens as the space expands. 24fps. |
| **Lighting** | Floor light line only. No overhead. The line is the only orientation. Wall edge glow barely visible at base. |
| **Sound** | Street noise dampens to silence over 5 meters. Temperature drops 2 degrees (implied by the visitor's breath). The sound of their own footsteps — sharp, echoing, then absorbed. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"The building does not greet you. The corridor does. It takes the noise. It takes the light. It leaves you with your own breathing."* |
| **Mood** | Threshold. Compression. The street is gone. |

## Scene 03: CHAMBER
**Timecode:** 0:08 – 0:14

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | 2F. A circular scanning platform surrounded by dark visualization walls. The visitor stands at center. Structured-light scanners activate — invisible to the eye, but the walls come alive. Biodata materializes in real time: movement trajectories as light trails, force distribution as heat maps, cadence as waveforms. The visitor sees their own body translated into data — abstract, luminous, personal. Their biodata streams radiate outward like the nervous system of a second body. The data is beautiful. |
| **Camera** | Slow orbital arc around the visitor (180°). The visualization walls fill the background. Close on the visitor's face as data reflects in their eyes. 60fps. |
| **Lighting** | No key light. The biodata visualization IS the light source. Cold white filaments, blue heat-map glow, data-node points. The visitor is lit by their own signal. |
| **Sound** | Low hum (40–80Hz). Barely audible, felt more than heard. The room vibrates. Biodata micro-ticks — dry, metallic, rhythmic. Each node emits a faint pulse. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"The body generates data. Movement. Force. Cadence. Breath. You have been speaking in signal your entire life. We are the first to listen."* |
| **Mood** | Intimacy. The body understood, not judged. |

---

## Scene 04: PAUSE
**Timecode:** 0:14 – 0:18

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | 3F. Warmth. A cafe — the first human space. Low furniture, dark leather, unglazed ceramic vessels. Amber light (2700K). The visitor sits. A black coffee on the table. Then: the departure board. A dark LED panel beside the elevator doors, Söhne Mono on void black. Characters flip like a split-flap display — mechanical, analog, precise. The board reads: "STATUS: NOW BOARDING." The elevator door seam emits a thin rim of Portal White light. The visitor rises. |
| **Camera** | Static wide on the cafe. Cut to close-up on the departure board as it updates. The split-flap characters flip one by one. 24fps. |
| **Lighting** | Warm amber ambient. The departure board is the coldest light in the room — Portal White on void black. The elevator door rim light is a blade of white. |
| **Sound** | Cafe warmth — quiet murmur, ceramic on surface, low ambient. Then: the mechanical flutter of the split-flap board updating. Click-click-click. Silence. The elevator hums. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Data reveals patterns. Yours are on file. The machine has computed your departure."* |
| **Mood** | Suspension. The calm before transit. |

---

## Scene 05: TRANSIT
**Timecode:** 0:18 – 0:26

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | The elevator. Doors close. Complete darkness. 1.5m x 1.5m x 2.4m — intimate, not spacious. Blackened steel walls, seamless. No buttons. No floor indicator. The visitor stands alone in total void. Then: a thin line of Portal White appears at the door seam — 1mm. Then 3mm. Growing. The light expands to outline the entire door frame. The visitor's hands become visible. Their reflection. The light intensifies. Something is clearly on the other side. The visitor's black card vibrates once — a single pulse. Silence. Then: the doors open. Slowly. 1200ms. Light from 5F floods in. |
| **Camera** | Locked. Centered on the visitor's face. Close-up in darkness. The rim light gradually reveals their features. When the doors open: the camera holds on them as light washes over their face — the first moment of full illumination in the film. 24fps. |
| **Lighting** | Total darkness → door-seam rim light (Portal White, building from 1mm to full frame outline) → flood of 5F environmental light. This is the film's key light moment. |
| **Sound** | 3 seconds of silence. Then: a low-frequency tone begins at 40Hz. Subwoofer. Felt in the chest. The tone rises — 40Hz to 60Hz. It stabilizes. Intensifies. Then: fades to silence. 2 seconds of held breath. Doors open: the mechanical sound of the slide (1200ms), and the atmospheric breath of 5F enters. |
| **Voice-Over** | *(No narration through the darkness. Let the tone speak. Then, as the doors open:)* *"Patterns shape form."* |
| **Mood** | Transit. The transformation. 42 seconds of real time compressed into 8 seconds of cinema. This is the emotional hinge. |

## Scene 06: REVEAL
**Timecode:** 0:26 – 0:32

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | 5F. The planetary environment. The elevator opens to the full vista — no corridor, no wall. The entire scenography visible from the first step. The floor texture has changed. The light is cold, directional, casting long shadows. Product vitrines emerge from the terrain like excavated artifacts — the Terrain Boot 01 recessed below floor level, visible through glass, lit from below. A Transit Shell suspended on a minimal armature at chest height, transparent membrane catching edge light. A dark monolith screen activates as the visitor approaches: "SIGNAL RECOGNIZED." Their body signal graphic appears. Then: "COMPUTED FOR YOUR BODY." |
| **Camera** | Wide from the elevator threshold — the full 5F vista. Then: steadicam follows the visitor as they move through the environment. Close on the floor-recessed boot vitrine — looking down at it, like an archaeological discovery. Close on the "SIGNAL RECOGNIZED" screen. 24fps + 60fps for product close-ups. |
| **Lighting** | Cold, directional. Long shadows. 5F is designed to feel like another world. Overhead cold-white. Individual vitrines lit from below or edge-lit. The recognition screen self-luminous. |
| **Sound** | Atmospheric breath — deep, slow, like wind across terrain (80–400Hz). Environmental. Faint data ticks when the recognition screen activates. The visitor's footsteps on the changed floor surface. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Not designed for the average. Computed for the singular. The garment knows your body before you wear it. Membrane. Shell. Lattice. A second architecture."* |
| **Mood** | Awe. The destination. The products belong here. So does the visitor. |

---

## Scene 07: WITNESS
**Timecode:** 0:32 – 0:37

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | 6F. The manufacturing theater. A glass partition separates the visitor from the fabrication floor. Through the glass: robotic arms under hard white work light, constructing a bone-white lattice boot layer by layer. Material deposits are visible — each filament placed with mechanical precision. A monitor shows real-time fabrication status: "LATTICE GENERATION / LAYER 2 OF 4 / SIGNAL SOURCE: DX-0847." The visitor watches through the glass. Their reflection overlaps with the machine behind it — human and machine in the same frame. Then: the handoff counter. A finished piece on a matte black tray, under a single downlight. Staff places it before the visitor with both hands. Makes eye contact. One word: "Your piece." |
| **Camera** | Through the glass — the visitor in the foreground, reflection visible, robotic arm in the background. Rack focus between them. Then: close on the handoff — the tray, the piece, the hands. 60fps for fabrication detail. 24fps for the handoff. |
| **Lighting** | Dark gallery side (recessed floor lights). Bright fabrication side (overhead industrial). The glass partition creates a membrane between dark and bright. The handoff moment: single downlight from above, everything else falls to void. |
| **Sound** | Muffled through glass: servo whir, material clicks, mechanical rhythm. On the visitor's side: silence. Then at handoff: all sound drops. The staff's voice — quiet, unhurried: "Your piece." |
| **Voice-Over** | *"No hand touches the material. Only the algorithm. Only the arm. Data as material. Computation as craft."* (Then silence for the handoff moment.) |
| **Mood** | Witness. Manufacturing is not hidden. It is the final act of transparency. |

---

## Scene 08: RELEASE
**Timecode:** 0:37 – 0:41

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | The descent. 4F: warm Bone-toned light (3000K). The darkness lifts. Functional silence. A matte Void-colored box with a single embossed period on the lid. The escalator — single direction, down. 4 floors. The airlock corridor in reverse. The floor light line now pulses at heartbeat rhythm — slow, biological, alive. The DUNE.X wordmark is no longer projected. The exit is simply a door. The visitor steps through. The street. Colors seem louder. The ordinary world is slightly disorienting. This is the intended aftereffect. |
| **Camera** | Steadicam following the visitor down. The escalator descent compresses floors. The airlock corridor — tracking behind them again, but now the pulsing light line leads outward. At the street door: the camera holds as the visitor walks into the city. Their silhouette shrinks. 24fps. |
| **Lighting** | Warm 4F → compressed darkness of escalator → the pulsing airlock → the blue-grey of the street. Temperature of light descends from warm to cool. The pulsing floor line is the heartbeat of the building, saying goodbye. |
| **Sound** | Functional quiet on 4F. The escalator hum. The airlock footsteps — precise, reverberant, then the city enters. Traffic. Wind. The acoustic shock of the ordinary world after 45 minutes in the void. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Performance is not born. It is engineered. The threshold is behind you now."* |
| **Mood** | Release. Decompression. The street feels different. Something has shifted. |

---

## Scene 09: END CARD
**Timecode:** 0:41 – 0:45

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visual** | 1 second of black. Then: "DUNE.X" materializes — Monument Extended Ultrabold, bone-white (#E8E0D4), wide-tracked (+100), centered. The period appears last. 1.5 seconds later: "FUTURE YOUR PERFORMANCE." in Söhne Mono Regular below. Holds. |
| **Camera** | Locked. Centered. |
| **Lighting** | Soft overhead wash illuminating only the text area. Rest of frame: void. |
| **Sound** | A single sustained tone — 220Hz, concert A. Warm, analog. Decays to silence over the final 4 seconds. |
| **Voice-Over** | *"Future your performance."* (Spoken in sync with the text appearing.) |
| **Duration** | 4.0s |

---

## Voice-Over Script (Complete — 45s)

**Delivery:** Low register. Unhurried. Gender-neutral. The voice is architecture, not performance. Each pause is as composed as each sentence.

**Pacing:** ~2.5 words/second. ~110 words total. Strategic silence at the transit hinge.

```

[09 END CARD — 0:41]
"Future your performance."
```

**Total VO:** ~110 words / 45 seconds
**Silence:** 2s (black) + 6s (elevator transit) = 8 seconds of deliberate silence (18%)

## Brand Philosophy Chain — Scene Mapping

The brand's core sequence is the narrative spine:

| Chain Link | Scene | How It Appears |
|---|---|---|
| *"The body generates data."* | 03 CHAMBER | Spoken as the biodata scan activates |
| *"Data reveals patterns."* | 04 PAUSE | Spoken as the departure board updates |
| *"Patterns shape form."* | 05 TRANSIT | Spoken as the elevator doors open to 5F |
| *"Form defines motion."* | 06 REVEAL | Implied — the product IS the form, on the visitor's body |

| Brand Value | Scene | How It's Shown |
|---|---|---|
| **Biodata Intelligence** | 03 CHAMBER | The scan, the visualization, "we are the first to listen" |
| **Departure Ready** | 04 PAUSE | The departure board, the boarding sequence, transit language |
| **Computational Craft** | 07 WITNESS | Robotic fabrication, "only the algorithm, only the arm" |
| **Membrane Architecture** | 06 REVEAL | Product vitrines, "membrane, shell, lattice, second architecture" |
| **Collective Curiosity** | 02 AIRLOCK | The open corridor — anyone can walk in |

## Technical Notes

### Transition Logic

Every transition mirrors the spatial UX principle: **light leads, darkness follows.**

| # | Between | Type | Duration | UX Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Black → Airlock | Floor light line fade-in | 1000ms | 1F light line pulsing forward |
| T2 | Airlock → Chamber | Cross-dissolve (light → data glow) | 1200ms | 1F→2F stairwell sound crossfade |
| T3 | Chamber → Pause | Light temperature shift (cold → amber) | 1000ms | 2F→3F sound crossfade, 2700K shift |
| T4 | Pause → Transit | Hard cut to black (doors close) | 200ms | Elevator doors closing |
| T5 | Transit → Reveal | Doors open — light flood (practical) | 1200ms | The 42-second transit optical effect |
| T6 | Reveal → Witness | Cross-dissolve | 1000ms | 5F→6F stair — landscape to lab |
| T7 | Witness → Release | Match dissolve (handoff tray → packaging box) | 1200ms | 6F→4F decompression |
| T8 | Release → End card | Natural fade to black | 2000ms | 1F exit — street absorbs the visitor |

**Note:** Scene 05 (TRANSIT) contains the only hard cut in the film — the elevator doors closing. Everything else flows.

### Sound Design Architecture

```

### Post-Production
- **Grade:** Desaturated. Selective warm accents in 3F cafe and 4F checkout only. Cold everywhere else. The elevator transit is near-monochrome.
- **Grain:** 35mm throughout. Heavier in the airlock, lighter in 5F reveal.
- **Transitions:** Cross-dissolves except the single hard cut (elevator doors). Each dissolve carries light logic from the spatial UX.
- **Title cards:** None during the film. Brand wordmark at end only.

### Camera
- Primary: ARRI ALEXA 65 (large format, maximum dynamic range for void environments)
- Lenses: Panavision Ultra Vista anamorphic (35mm for corridors, 50mm for medium, 85mm for close-ups, 100mm macro for fabrication detail)
- Squeeze: 1.65x (natural oval bokeh, horizontal flare on the elevator rim light)

### Production Approach
- **Scene 02 (Airlock):** Practical set build. 10m corridor, 1.2m wide, 2.4m ceiling. Real floor light line. Real acoustic dampening.
- **Scene 03 (Chamber):** LED volume stage or practical set with projection walls. Real structured-light scanner for authenticity. Data visualization composited in post.
- **Scene 04 (Pause):** Practical cafe set. Real split-flap departure board (or high-fidelity digital replica). Real ceramic vessels.
- **Scene 05 (Transit):** Practical elevator interior set. 1.5m x 1.5m. Real subwoofer in floor. Real LED rim light on door seam, hardware-controlled crescendo.
- **Scene 06 (Reveal):** LED volume stage for planetary environment. Practical product vitrines with real products. Real recognition screen (live generative).
- **Scene 07 (Witness):** Practical set with two-sided glass partition. Real robotic arm (or high-fidelity prop). Real fabrication cell dressing.
- **Scene 08 (Release):** Practical escalator location. Real airlock corridor set (redressed from Scene 02). Real street exterior.
