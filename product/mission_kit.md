# DUNE.X — MISSION KIT

## Accessories Specification

---

The Mission Kit is the departure set. Three objects designed to be packed alongside the Transit Shell and Terrain Boot — completing the system. Where the shell and boot are custom, the kit is mostly standard: produced in the Frame grid, available for immediate purchase, and carrying the collective data signature of every customer who came before.

### Concept

A bag whose surface is generated by the bodies of everyone who has been scanned before.

Transit Pack 01 uses aggregated, anonymized biodata from DUNE.X customers to generate its surface pattern. The faceted panel geometry is not designed — it is the output of a generative algorithm that processes collective gait data, pressure maps, and body scan point clouds into a tessellation pattern. Each production run draws from the latest dataset. The pattern evolves as more bodies contribute data.

The pack is standard-sized but carries the collective signature. Your data is in its surface, alongside everyone else who has departed.

### Construction

**Silhouette:** Rectangular backpack, 480 x 300 x 160mm (H x W x D). Clean geometric form. No external pockets visible from front face.

**Panel system:**
- **Outer shell:** 12 faceted panels of 420D ripstop nylon with TPU film lamination
- **Panel geometry:** Generative Voronoi tessellation derived from aggregated biodata — no two production runs have identical panel layouts
- **Panel joining:** RF-welded seams (same process as Transit Shell 01). No stitching on exterior surface.
- **Panel surface:** Matte finish with micro-texture at panel centers, smooth at weld lines. Under edge light, the facets catch light at different angles — the bag reads as a cut gem, not a soft container.

**Internal structure:**
- **Main compartment:** Single volume, 20L capacity. Laptop sleeve (fits up to 16" device, padded, suspended from base). Internal mesh organizer pocket.
- **Secondary compartment:** Front-face flat pocket (concealed RF-welded zip entry), 2L capacity. For documents, tablet, flat objects.
- **Top access:** Roll-top closure secured by magnetic buckle (sand-cast aluminum, DUNE.X period mark debossed). Weather-sealed when rolled 3x.

**Harness:**
- **Shoulder straps:** 50mm width, curved cut following average shoulder scan data. Internal padding: 8mm closed-cell EVA. Outer: matching TPU-laminated ripstop.
- **Sternum strap:** Adjustable, 20mm webbing with aluminum slider and magnetic clip.
- **Back panel:** Ventilated mesh over 10mm EVA, channel-cut for airflow. Concealed luggage pass-through strap.
- **Attachment points:** 4 x MOLLE-compatible webbing loops on lateral faces. Compatible with Transit Shell 01 internal clip system (the pack attaches to the jacket's rear panel for hands-free transit).

**Hardware:**
- Sand-cast aluminum: magnetic roll-top buckle, sternum clip, cord locks (x2)
- YKK Aquaguard #5 zippers on secondary compartment and internal organizer
- All hardware is Void (black anodized) or Bone (brushed natural) to match colorway

### Colorways

**Void:** Matte black TPU-laminated ripstop. Black RF-weld seams read as geometric grid lines. Black anodized aluminum hardware. The pack absorbs light — the faceted panels become visible only under directional illumination, where the angular geometry creates shifting highlights.

**Bone:** Off-white TPU-laminated ripstop. Pale weld seams. Brushed aluminum hardware. The faceted geometry is immediately legible — the pack reads as a carved object, its surface a visible map of collective biodata.

## VISOR 01

### Product Identity

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Product Name** | VISOR 01 |
| **Collection** | DEPARTURE 001 |
| **Category** | Eyewear |
| **Designation** | Semi-Custom |
| **Price** | $280–340 |
| **Colorways** | Void, Bone |
| **SKU Format** | DX-VS01-[UNIT ID] |

### Concept

Eyewear fitted to the face that owns it.

Visor 01 is a single-lens shield with a parametric frame adjusted from face-scan data. The frame is standard in design but custom in fit — temple width, nose bridge depth, lens rake angle, and temple curve are each adjusted within defined tolerances to match the individual's facial geometry. Not bespoke manufacturing. Precision adjustment of a fixed architecture.

The lens is the visor for the threshold — a single continuous shield that reads as protective equipment, not fashion eyewear. The aesthetic is clinical. The fit is personal.

### Construction

**Lens:**
- **Type:** Single-piece polycarbonate shield, injection molded
- **Dimensions:** 155mm width x 52mm height (lens area)
- **Thickness:** 2.2mm (optically uniform)
- **Coating:** Anti-reflective interior, hydrophobic exterior, UV400 protection
- **Tint:** Category 3 (8–18% VLT) — medium-dark. Suitable for bright daylight.
- **Color options:**
  - Void: Smoke-black lens (10% VLT), near-opaque from exterior
  - Bone: Pale grey lens (18% VLT), semi-transparent, eyes visible behind shield

**Frame:**
- **Material:** Glass-filled nylon (PA12-GF), injection molded
- **Structure:** Continuous brow bar + integrated temple arms. No hinges — the frame is a single-piece structure that flexes at engineered thin-wall zones behind the ears
- **Profile:** Minimal — 4mm brow bar width, 3mm temple width. The lens dominates; the frame disappears.
- **Finish:** Matte, color-matched (Void: matte black; Bone: matte off-white)

**Nose bridge:**
- **Material:** Medical-grade silicone, overmolded onto frame
- **Adjustment:** Bridge width and pad angle are set during manufacturing based on face-scan data
- **Range:** Bridge width 16–24mm, pad angle 8–18 degrees

**Temple arms:**
- **Flex zone:** Thin-wall section (1.2mm) at 60mm from temple tip — provides controlled flex for comfort and donning
- **Temple tip:** Silicone-tipped, curved per face-scan ear profile
- **Temple width (total):** Adjusted per face scan within 132–148mm range

### Face-Scan Fit Process

The Visor 01 fit scan is a subset of the full 2F scanning experience:

| Measurement | Method | Applied To |
|---|---|---|
| Interpupillary distance | Face scan, automated detection | Lens optical center placement |
| Temple width | Face scan, temporal bone width | Temple arm splay angle |
| Nose bridge width | Face scan, nasal bone measurement | Bridge pad width setting |
| Nose bridge angle | Face scan, nasal slope | Bridge pad angle |
| Ear position (height, depth) | Face scan, ear landmark detection | Temple curve profile and flex zone position |

Scan duration: 8 seconds (part of the structured-light face/head scan).
Processing: 2 hours.
Manufacturing adjustment: CNC trim of bridge and temple profiles from base mold. 30 minutes per unit.

**Lead time:** 1-2 days from scan.

### Colorways

**Void:** Matte black frame, smoke-black lens. The visor reads as a continuous dark surface — frame and lens merge into a single object. The wearer's eyes are not visible. The face becomes a surface.

**Bone:** Matte off-white frame, pale grey lens. The eyes are faintly visible behind the shield. The frame reads as a delicate structural line against the face. Clinical. Specimen-like.

### Dimensions and Weight

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Lens width | 155mm |
| Lens height | 52mm |
| Temple length | 140mm (adjustable range: 136–144mm) |
| Bridge width | 16–24mm (set per face scan) |
| Weight | 38g |

### Packaging

Visor 01 ships in a rigid hinged case — injection-molded TPU, same faceted panel language as Specimen Container 01. Magnetic closure. Interior: microfiber-lined cradle. Includes silicone-tipped cleaning tool and face-scan summary card.

## SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01

### Product Identity

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Product Name** | SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01 |
| **Collection** | DEPARTURE 001 |
| **Category** | Hard Case |
| **Designation** | Standard |
| **Price** | $140–180 |
| **Colorways** | Void, Bone |
| **SKU Format** | DX-SC01-[COLORWAY] |

### Concept

The object that holds the object.

Specimen Container 01 is the carrying case for the Terrain Boot 01 — and it is also a standalone product. A hard-shell container with DUNE.X faceted geometry, designed to store, protect, and present. It is the specimen jar for engineered objects. The boot arrives in it. Other objects live in it after.

The container is standard — no biodata customization. Its surface geometry uses the same Voronoi tessellation algorithm as the Transit Pack, but at a fixed configuration derived from the DUNE.X parametric pattern library.

### Construction

**Shell:**
- **Material:** Injection-molded polycarbonate
- **Wall thickness:** 2.5mm
- **Surface:** Faceted panel geometry — 18 Voronoi-tessellated faces across the lid and base. Each facet is a slightly different angle, creating geometric light play.
- **Finish:** Matte exterior, smooth interior
- **Joint:** Clamshell hinge, 180-degree opening. Die-cast aluminum hinge pins.
- **Closure:** Double magnetic catch + single compression latch (sand-cast aluminum, DUNE.X period mark)

**Interior:**
- **Lining:** 12mm die-cut EVA foam cradle, shaped to Terrain Boot 01 profile (standard mid-size profile)
- **Capacity:** Fits Terrain Boot 01 up to Frame 06 equivalent
- **Accessories tray:** Removable shallow tray (50mm depth) for biodata cards, lacing, care kit
- **Surface:** Non-slip micro-dot texture on EVA

**Details:**
- **Carry handle:** Integrated into lid geometry — a recessed channel in the polycarbonate, 120mm grip length, no added material
- **Stacking:** Flat base with 4 non-slip pads. Containers stack securely.
- **Embossing:** DUNE.X period mark debossed on lid center, 30mm diameter. Subtle — visible only under angled light.

### Colorways

**Void:** Matte black polycarbonate. The faceted geometry is the only surface articulation — light catches the angular planes, creating a slowly shifting highlight map as viewing angle changes. Black aluminum hardware.

**Bone:** Matte off-white polycarbonate. The facets are more visible — each panel catches light differently, giving the surface a carved, mineral quality. Brushed aluminum hardware.

### Dimensions and Weight

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Length | 360mm |
| Width | 240mm |
| Height (closed) | 180mm |
| Wall thickness | 2.5mm |
| Interior volume | ~12L |
| Weight (empty) | 640g |

## Mission Kit System Notes

### Unified Design Language

All three Mission Kit objects share:
- **Faceted Voronoi tessellation** as primary surface language
- **RF-welded or sealed joints** (no visible stitching on exterior surfaces)
- **Sand-cast aluminum hardware** with DUNE.X period mark
- **Void and Bone** as the only colorways
- **Matte surface finish** with micro-texture variation

The Mission Kit reads as a set. Objects that belong together — not through branding or logos, but through shared geometric logic. The same algorithm that tiles the Transit Pack's surface generates the Specimen Container's shell. The same welding process that seals the Transit Shell's membrane seals the Pack's panels.

### Cross-Product Compatibility

| Interface | Products | Function |
|---|---|---|
| MOLLE attachment | Transit Pack 01 + Transit Shell 01 | Pack clips to jacket rear panel |
| Specimen fit | Specimen Container 01 + Terrain Boot 01 | Boot cradle sized for boot |
| Visor stow | Visor 01 + Transit Pack 01 | Visor case fits in Pack secondary compartment |

The system is designed as a departure kit. Every piece has a place. Every object relates to every other object through interface or containment. You do not buy separate products. You assemble a system.
