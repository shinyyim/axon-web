# DUNE.X — Naming System

---

## Purpose

This document defines how every product, collection, campaign, colorway, and size designation is named across DUNE.X. All teams must follow this system. Naming is architecture. Every word carries load.

---

## Collection Tiers

DUNE.X products are organized into three tiers. The tier defines the product's engineering depth, biodata integration, production method, and price position. Every product belongs to exactly one tier.

### PROTOCOL

Foundational pieces. Every-wear engineered basics. The ground layer of the departure system.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Engineering** | Standard construction from established patterns. Frame-sized. |
| **Biodata** | None required for purchase. Surface patterns on PROTOCOL pieces are derived from aggregated, anonymized biodata — the collective signal shapes the generative texture. |
| **Production** | Pre-manufactured in Frame sizes. Available for immediate purchase. |
| **Price range** | $140–260 |
| **Materials** | Engineered textiles, sealed membranes, bonded composites. Honest materials, no decoration. |
| **Examples** | Base layers, containers, bands, foundational accessories |

### TRANSIT

Performance shells. Outerwear, technical layers, and functional carry systems. The architecture between body and environment.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Engineering** | Advanced construction. Custom pieces are computed from individual biodata. Standard pieces use Frame sizing with generative patterning. |
| **Biodata** | Required for custom pieces (3D body scan, thermal map, range of motion). Optional for standard pieces. |
| **Production** | Custom: manufactured on-site at 6F, 3-7 day lead time. Standard: pre-manufactured, immediate. |
| **Price range** | $320–840 |
| **Materials** | Multi-layer adaptive composites, parametric-cut membranes, 3D-printed structural elements, sealed seam architecture. |
| **Examples** | Outerwear shells, technical packs, protective layers |

### SIGNAL

Limited production. Biodata-reactive. Highest engineering density. The pieces that exist at the outermost edge of the system.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Engineering** | Maximum computational integration. Every SIGNAL piece requires biodata capture. The product is fully singular — computed for one body, unrepeatable. |
| **Biodata** | Mandatory. Multiple scan types (gait analysis, pressure mapping, thermal distribution, range of motion). The biodata does not adjust the product. The biodata generates the product. |
| **Production** | On-site manufacturing only. No online purchase. No standard sizing. 5-10 day lead time. |
| **Price range** | $480–1200+ |
| **Materials** | PA12 nylon lattice, biodata-generated geometries, adaptive membrane systems, computational surface treatments. |
| **Examples** | Footwear with computed sole geometry, fully singular outerwear, biodata-reactive accessories |

## Product Naming Format

### Structure

```
[FUNCTION] [TYPE] [VERSION]
```

Every DUNE.X product name has exactly three components. No more. No fewer.

| Component | Rule | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **FUNCTION** | Describes the operational context or body zone. One word. Drawn from approved vocabulary. | TERRAIN, TRANSIT, SIGNAL, SPECIMEN, DATUM |
| **TYPE** | Describes the object category. One word. | BOOT, SHELL, LAYER, PACK, VISOR, CONTAINER, BAND |
| **VERSION** | Two-digit zero-padded sequence number. | 01, 02, 03 |

### Rules

1. **Always ALL CAPS.** In all designed applications, product names are set in Monument Extended, ALL CAPS. In running body text, ALL CAPS is still required.
2. **Maximum two words before the version number.** "TERRAIN BOOT 01" — never "TERRAIN PERFORMANCE BOOT 01."
3. **Version numbers are always two digits.** 01, 02, 03. Not 1, 2, 3. Not v1. Not Ver. 1. Not 001.
4. **No adjectives.** The name is functional. "TRANSIT SHELL" not "ADVANCED TRANSIT SHELL." Not "TRANSIT SHELL PRO."
5. **No suffixes.** No Ultra, Pro, Max, Elite, Plus, Lite, SE, X, GT, EVO. The version number is the only modifier.
6. **No colorway in the product name.** "TERRAIN BOOT 01" in colorway Void. Not "TERRAIN BOOT 01 VOID."
7. **No gendered designation.** Products are not "Men's" or "Women's." The body is a set of dimensions.
8. **When used as a headline, end with a period.** "TERRAIN BOOT 01." The period signals completeness.
9. **When referenced in body text, no period.** "The Terrain Boot 01 features a computed lattice sole."

### Product Identifier (SKU Format)

For internal tracking and custom piece identification:

```
DX-[PRODUCT CODE]-[UNIQUE ID or FRAME]
```

| Product | Code | Custom Example | Standard Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| TERRAIN BOOT 01 | TB01 | DX-TB01-4729 | DX-TB01-F04 |
| TRANSIT SHELL 01 | TS01 | DX-TS01-3182 | — |
| SIGNAL LAYER 01 | SL01 | — | DX-SL01-F03 |
| TRANSIT PACK 01 | TP01 | — | DX-TP01-STD |
| VISOR 01 | VS01 | DX-VS01-1847 | — |
| SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01 | SC01 | — | DX-SC01-STD |
| DATUM BAND 01 | DB01 | — | DX-DB01-STD |

- Custom pieces: four-digit unique ID (sequential production number)
- Standard pieces: Frame number (F01–F08) or STD for one-size products

## DEPARTURE 001 — Tier Mapping

The first DUNE.X collection. Seven pieces. Three tiers. One system.

| # | Product | Tier | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | **TERRAIN BOOT 01** | SIGNAL | Sole geometry is fully computed from individual gait data. No two units are identical. Maximum biodata integration. The hero product. |
| 02 | **TRANSIT SHELL 01** | TRANSIT | Custom outerwear computed from 3D body scan. Multi-layer adaptive construction. Also available in Frame sizing for standard purchase. |
| 03 | **SIGNAL LAYER 01** | PROTOCOL | Foundational base layer. Frame-sized. Generative surface pattern derived from aggregated biodata. |
| 04 | **TRANSIT PACK 01** | TRANSIT | Engineered carry system. Structural attachment points interface with Transit Shell. Standard sizing with generative patterning. |
| 05 | **VISOR 01** | TRANSIT | Semi-custom eyewear. Fit adjusted from face-scan geometry. Fixed structural design with variable parameters. |
| 06 | **SPECIMEN CONTAINER 01** | PROTOCOL | Hard-case accessory. Standard production. Surface lattice pattern derived from Terrain Boot computational output. |
| 07 | **DATUM BAND 01** | PROTOCOL | Wrist-mounted biodata capture interface. Standard sizing. This piece generates the data that shapes future collections. |

### Tier Distribution

- **SIGNAL:** 1 piece (Terrain Boot 01) — the peak, the rarest, the most engineered
- **TRANSIT:** 3 pieces (Transit Shell, Transit Pack, Visor) — the functional architecture
- **PROTOCOL:** 3 pieces (Signal Layer, Specimen Container, Datum Band) — the ground layer

This ratio (1:3:3) should be maintained in future collections. SIGNAL is always the minority. PROTOCOL is always the foundation.

## Drop and Campaign Naming

### Drop Names

Drops are named with a single word from the approved vocabulary, followed by a three-digit sequence number. No adjectives. No season names.

**Format:** `[WORD] [THREE-DIGIT NUMBER]`

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **DEPARTURE 001** | The first drop. The act of leaving. |
| **THRESHOLD 002** | Second drop. The boundary. |
| **TRANSIT 003** | Third drop. The passage. |
| **VECTOR 004** | Fourth drop. Direction of movement. |

**Rules:**

- Drop names draw from the Spatial/Transit vocabulary bank
- Three-digit sequence: 001, 002, 003. Not 01 or 1.
- Drop names are always ALL CAPS in Monument Extended
- The drop name is not the collection name. The drop name is the codename for the release event.

### Campaign Codenames

Campaigns within a drop use single-word codenames followed by a period. These appear on tease materials, social content, and ambient displays.

**Format:** `[WORD].`

| Drop | Phase | Codename |
|---|---|---|
| DEPARTURE 001 | TEASE (T-60) | THRESHOLD. |
| DEPARTURE 001 | REVEAL (T-30) | TERRAIN. |
| DEPARTURE 001 | SYSTEM (T-0) | DEPARTURE. |
| DEPARTURE 001 | FLAGSHIP (T+14) | STATION. |

**Rules:**

- One word only. Maximum 10 characters.
- Always ends with a period. The period is the brand pause.
- Set in Monument Extended, ALL CAPS, wide-tracked.
- Campaign codenames do not appear on products. They are marketing-layer only.
- Each codename is used for one campaign phase, then retired.

## Colorway Names

Colorways are named from environmental conditions in the DUNE.X world. They are permanent — not seasonal, not trend-driven. A colorway name is the material condition of the color, not a description of the color itself.

### Active Colorways

| Colorway | Hex | Description | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Void** | #0A0A0C | Near-black. The absence before the portal opens. Carbon-dark surfaces. | Launch |
| **Bone** | #E8E0D4 | Off-white. Light reflected off structure. Architectural white. | Launch |
| **Signal** | #E94520 | Red-orange. Human warmth. Applied at 5% surface area maximum. Never full-garment. | T+60 limited accent |
| **Haze** | #2A2A30 | Dark grey. The color between Void and visible. Linings, interior surfaces. | Structural only |
| **Dust** | #8B7D6B | Muted earth tone. Secondary surfaces. | Future collection |
| **Atmosphere** | #F5F0E8 | Off-white. Warm light conditions. | Future collection |

### Colorway Naming Rules

1. **One word only.** Not "Deep Void" or "Matte Bone." Just: Void. Bone. Signal.
2. **Names describe conditions, not colors.** "Void" is the absence of light, not "black." "Bone" is a structural material, not "cream."
3. **No seasonal colors.** No "Spring Sage" or "Winter Slate." The palette is permanent.
4. **No materials-as-colors.** No "Chrome", "Obsidian", "Ivory." These are borrowed from other industries.
5. **New colorway names must come from the DUNE.X world.** Potential future names: Regolith, Threshold, Pressure, Orbit, Filament. Each must describe a condition, not a color.
6. **Colorway is stated as a specification, not a feature.** Write: "Colorway: Void" — not "Available in our stunning Void colorway."

## Size System

### Custom Pieces (SIGNAL Tier)

No traditional sizing. The body is the template.

- Each product is generated from a unique biodata profile captured at 2F
- The output is singular: one body, one unit, unrepeatable
- Identifier: `DX-[CODE]-[UNIQUE ID]` (e.g., DX-TB01-4729)
- For biodata-driven custom pieces, "size" is replaced by "biometric profile hash" — a unique alphanumeric identifier derived from the individual's scan data

### Standard Pieces (PROTOCOL and TRANSIT Standard)

The **Frame** system. A dimensional grid based on body measurements. Not S/M/L abstraction. Not gendered.

| Designation | Chest (cm) | Waist (cm) | Hip (cm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frame 01 | 82–86 | 66–70 | 86–90 |
| Frame 02 | 87–91 | 71–75 | 91–95 |
| Frame 03 | 92–96 | 76–80 | 96–100 |
| Frame 04 | 97–101 | 81–85 | 101–105 |
| Frame 05 | 102–106 | 86–90 | 106–110 |
| Frame 06 | 107–112 | 91–96 | 111–116 |
| Frame 07 | 113–118 | 97–102 | 117–122 |
| Frame 08 | 119–124 | 103–108 | 123–128 |

**Rules:**

- Always written as "Frame 01" — not "F1", not "Size 1", not "Small"
- In UX: dropdown reads "Frame 01", "Frame 02", etc.
- Frame is gender-neutral. The body is dimensions, not category.
- One-size products (Specimen Container, Datum Band) use "Standard" — no frame designation

### Semi-Custom Pieces (TRANSIT Tier — Visor)

Base structural design is fixed. Fit parameters adjusted from face-scan data within defined tolerances.

- Not Frame-sized
- Not fully custom
- Designation: "Scan-fit" — the product is adjusted, not generated

---

## Future Naming Conventions

### Collection Succession

When DEPARTURE 001 is followed by new drops:

- New collections receive new drop names from the vocabulary bank
- Product versions increment: TERRAIN BOOT 02, TRANSIT SHELL 02
- New product types receive new FUNCTION TYPE names from the vocabulary bank
- The tier system (PROTOCOL / TRANSIT / SIGNAL) is permanent across all collections
- The 1:3:3 tier ratio (or similar weighted distribution) persists

### Product Retirement

- Retired products are not "discontinued." They are "completed."
- Copy: "TERRAIN BOOT 01 — production complete. 4,729 units manufactured."
- Retired products remain in the archive section of the website indefinitely

### Naming Approval Process

All new product and campaign names require Brand Strategy sign-off before any team uses them in production materials. The naming system is centrally controlled. No team creates names independently.
